<h1 title="">RILLA OF THE
<br />LIGHTHOUSE</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I.
<br />RILLA.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Here yo&rsquo;, Shags! What yo&rsquo; got thar, ol&rsquo; dog?
Haul it out! Like it&rsquo;s a treasure from a ship that&rsquo;s
gone down. Ahoy, thar, Shagsie! Here comes a
crashin&rsquo; big wave. Whoo! Wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t that-un a tarnal
whopper? An&rsquo; yo&rsquo; lost yer treasure, sure sartin!
Sharp ahead now, ol&rsquo; dog, d&rsquo;y see it anywhar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind-blown girl and the big shaggy dog stood
side by side on the narrow, pebbly strip of beach
and gazed intently at the whirling, seething water
where a breaker of unusual size had crashed high,
sending these two for a moment scrambling up the
rocks.</p>
<p>Back of them towered an almost perpendicular
cliff, on top of which stood the Windy Island Lighthouse,
severe in outline, but glaring red and white in
color that it might be readily observed in the daytime
by pilots who were strangers in those dangerous
waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>Many a shoal there was under the tossing, turbulent
waves, unsuspected by the unwary mariner, and,
in the heavy fogs that often hung like wet, impenetrable
blankets over that part of the New England
coast, many a vessel would have crashed to its destruction
had it not been for the faithful Captain
Ezra Bassett, who had been keeper of the light since
Rilla was a baby.</p>
<p>The dog&rsquo;s sight must have been keener than that
of the girl, for a moment later he dashed away up
the narrow strip of beach and began to bark furiously
at some object that was tossing on an incoming
wave. The girl raced after him, her hazel eyes
glowing with excitement, her long brown hair, with
a glint of red in it, unfastened, flying back of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the same thing, Shagsie!&rdquo; she shouted to
her companion. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t what yo&rsquo; was tryin&rsquo; to
fetch ashore down below by the rocks. This-un is
more like a box or suthin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eager expression in the girl&rsquo;s big, starlike eyes
changed to one of concern and anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shags,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;thar&rsquo;s been a wreck, that&rsquo;s
sure sartin, but &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hereabouts, &rsquo;pears like.&rdquo; She
shaded her eyes with one hand, and gazed searchingly
out toward the horizon, but in another moment
her eager interest returned to the box. &ldquo;Look, yo&rsquo;
ol&rsquo; dog. It&rsquo;s ridin&rsquo; high. We&rsquo;ll get it, yo&rsquo; see if we
don&rsquo;t. Yi-hi! Here she comes. Heave ahead now,
Shagsie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog raced around, barking wildly, but the
barefooted girl plunged deep into the seething foam,
caught a banded box of foreign appearance and held
on with all her strength while the undertow tried to
drag her treasure away, but the wave receded and
the box was left high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got it, ol&rsquo; Shags. We got it!&rdquo; she cried triumphantly,
tossing back her sun-shimmered hair,
for, when she had stooped, it had fallen about her
face. This hindered the freedom of her movements,
and so, snatching up a wet green ribbon of seaweed,
she tied her hair back with it. Another wave was
rushing, roaring shoreward. One quick seaward
glance told her that it was going to be the biggest
one yet.</p>
<p>Could she get the box high enough to be out of
reach of that next breaker? How she tugged! But
her efforts were fruitless, for with a deafening thud
the wave crashed over her, lifting the box to which
she still clung and hurling them both farther up the
beach.</p>
<p>The girl was drenched but exultant and miraculously
unhurt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got it now, sure sartin, Shags, ol&rsquo; dog.&rdquo;
Flushed and breathless, she sank down on the banded
box for a moment to rest, but the dog, sniffing at
it, barked his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;d like to know what&rsquo;s in it, would yo&rsquo;?&rdquo;
queried the laughing girl. &ldquo;Well, sir, so would I,
but like as not we&rsquo;d better get it into Treasure Cave
&rsquo;fore we open it, like as not we&rsquo;d better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girl spoke she glanced up at the lighthouse,
towering above her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand-dad&rsquo;s still asleep, I reckon, but &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
long now afore he&rsquo;s wakin&rsquo;, so we&rsquo;d better heave to
and hist her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rilla had found a leather handle on one end of the
box, and holding fast to this, slowly and with great
effort she began dragging it up the rocks and about
half an hour later, as a reward for her perseverence,
she disappeared with it into a small opening in the
cliff, and not a moment too soon, for a stentorian
voice, high above her, called, &ldquo;Rilly gal, where be
yo&rsquo;? Don&rsquo; yo&rsquo; know as it&rsquo;s past time for mess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, Grand-dad. We was just a-comin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
Which was the truth, for having safely hidden the
box in her Treasure Cave, the girl had suddenly
thought that she must go at once and prepare her
grandfather&rsquo;s evening meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shagsie,&rdquo; she confided, &ldquo;ol&rsquo; dog, we&rsquo;ll have to
wait over till tomorrer to know what&rsquo;s in it. We&rsquo;ll
come an&rsquo; look as soon as its sun-up. Yo-o! How
I hope it&rsquo;s suthin&rsquo; wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>When Muriel Storm entered the kitchen of the
small house adjoining the light, her grandfather
gazed at her keenly from under his shaggy grey
brows. &ldquo;A severe, unforgiving man,&rdquo; some folks
called him, but he hadn&rsquo;t looked long at the darling
of his heart before his expression changed, softened
until those grey eyes that had often struck terror to
an offending deckhand shone with a light that was
infinitely tender.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Rilly gal, fust mate of the Lighthouse
Craft, I cal&rsquo;late ye&rsquo;ve been workin&rsquo; purty hard this
past hour doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;. &rsquo;Pears like yer purty het up
lookin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl made no reply, though she laughed over
her shoulder at the old man, who, with his cap
pushed back, sat by the stove in his wooden armchair,
smoking his corncob pipe in solid comfort.</p>
<p>This was the hour that he liked best, when his gal
was cooking his evening meal and chattering to him
of this and that&mdash;inconsequential things&mdash;telling
him how the lame pelican that had been away for a
week had returned, but not alone, for a beautiful
pelican that wasn&rsquo;t lame at all had been with him,
or, when she wasn&rsquo;t chattering, she was singing
meeting-house songs in her sweet untrained voice
while she fried the fish and potatoes, but tonight the
old captain noted that the girl was unusually silent,
that her cheeks were almost feverishly red, and there
was a sudden clutching dread in his heart. Just so
had the other Rilly, this girl&rsquo;s mother, looked and
acted the day before she ran away and married the
young man from the city. The eyes under the shaggy
grey brows were hard again, and Rilla, noting in
the face of the grand-dad she so loved the expression
she dreaded, ran to him, fork in hand and
pressing her cheek against his forehead, she cried:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grand-dad, what set yo&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that?
Yo&rsquo; know I wouldn&rsquo;t be leavin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;. I love yo&rsquo;,
Grand-dad; I&rsquo;ll allays, allays stay, an&rsquo; be yer fust
mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear to the end of the v&rsquo;yage? Take an oath to
it, Rilly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It might have seemed ludicrous to an onlooker,
but there was no one to see as the girl, with an
earnest, almost inspired expression on her truly
beautiful face, stood up and lifting her hand, seemingly
unconscious that it held a fork, said in a voice
ringing with sincerity, &ldquo;I call God to witness that
I&rsquo;ll never go away from yo&rsquo;, Grand-dad, without yer
permittin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was one of those sudden changes that
made Rilla so irresistable. &ldquo;Grand-dad,&rdquo; she cried,
teasingly, as she stooped and looked with laughing
eyes directly into the grey ones that were softening
again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only sixteen, come next month, and why
&rsquo;tis yo&rsquo; worry so &rsquo;bout my marryin&rsquo;, sartin is puzzlin&rsquo;.
I don&rsquo;t even know a boy &rsquo;ceptin&rsquo; Mrs. Sol
Dexter&rsquo;s Buddy, and he&rsquo;s not as high as one of the
barrels in his ma&rsquo;s store.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yer heavin&rsquo; oil on troubled waters, and the sea&rsquo;s
smoothin&rsquo; down,&rdquo; the old captain said as he drew his
chair up to the table and took up his knife and fork
preparatory to eating the good supper that Rilla had
placed before him. But, instead of beginning, he
remarked: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figger out why I keep thinkin&rsquo;
of city fellers this week past. They don&rsquo;t any of
&rsquo;em come to Tunkett at this time o&rsquo; the year. That
thar summer hotel at the pint is closed as tight as a
clam that can&rsquo;t be opened without smashin&rsquo; it, an&rsquo; so
are the cottages, as the rich folks call them gray
shanties they loaf around in every summer, so I
figger yer ol&rsquo; grand-dad must be gettin&rsquo; hallucinations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the supper dishes had been washed and put
away, Rilla found her grandfather sitting just outside
the door smoking his beloved corncob pipe and
watching the sunset. She went out and sat on a
wooden stool at his feet. Rilla loved to sit quietly
with folded hands while the glow was fading in the
west and dream dreams. Just as the last flush was
paling the old man rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to put the light on, Rilly gal,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>She heard his heavy steps climbing the spiral
stairs. Fainter and fainter they grew, and then, a
moment later, just as the first stars glimmered
through the dusk, the great light flashed over the
sea and began slowly turning, for the lighthouse was
on an island one mile from shore, and the waters all
about it were illumined.</p>
<p>For a moment Rilla saw a fishing boat that was
nearly becalmed and would have trouble reaching
port that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ol&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;n Barney, like&rsquo;s not. He&rsquo;s allays
late gettin&rsquo; in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose and went indoors. Shags, who had
been lying silently at her feet, accompanied her.
&ldquo;Good-night, Grand-dad,&rdquo; she said, standing on tiptoe
to kiss the old man, who stood erect in spite of
his many years.</p>
<p>Then almost shyly she added: &ldquo;Grand-dad, when
I come sixteen yer goin&rsquo; to tell me all about it, like
yo&rsquo; promised, aren&rsquo;t yo&rsquo;, Grand-dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grunt, which could hardly be interpreted in the
affirmative, was the only reply, and yet neither had
it been negative.</p>
<p>Kissing him again, Rilla went to her snug little
room over the kitchen, and Shags followed, for he
always slept just outside her closed door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>Rilla did not light the kerosene lamp that stood on
the small table. The moon was rising and she liked
its light best. For a moment she stood at the open
window, facing the town, which in the fall and winter
was so dark and quiet in the evening, but in
summer, when the city people were in their cabins
on the point, it was pulsing with life, color and
music. Rilla never visited the town in summer. She
was then practically a prisoner on the small rocky
island. For a long time she stood watching the
waves that lifted silvery crests in the moonlight. &ldquo;I
wonder who my dad was,&rdquo; she thought, as she had
many times before. &ldquo;I wonder why he never came
for me, after my girl-mother died.&rdquo; Forgotten was
the box in Treasure Cave.</p>
<p>Many had been the moods of Rilla that day, but
when she had undressed in the moonlight she knelt,
not by the bedside, but facing the window. Looking
up toward the peaceful, starry sky, she whispered
softly, &ldquo;God in Heaven, bless my grand-dad, and&mdash;and
my father&mdash;who never came for me. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon she was asleep, little dreaming that the next
day was to bring into her hitherto quiet and uneventful
life her first real adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II.
<br />A GIFT FROM THE SEA.</h2>
<p>Sunrise and the memory of the treasure box
came at the same time. Rilla was dressed in a
twinkling. She did not even stop to peer into the
bit of broken mirror which Mrs. Sol Dexter had
given her, hoping that with it would go the proverbial
seven years of bad luck. Mrs. Sol Dexter
kept the general store and postoffice in the fishing
village of Tunkett.</p>
<p>She was absolutely honest, was Mrs. Sol, but not
inclined to be generous. If the scales tipped one
cranberry too many, out came that cranberry! She
had never before been known to give anything away,
but something which might bring bad luck she had
been willing to part with.</p>
<p>It had been a happy day for Rilla, that one, when
for the first time she had acquired a real mirror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>It was, of course, after the summer season, or
she would not have been in town at all. And on
that same day her grand-dad had given her a whole
quarter to spend just as she wished and she had
asked Mrs. Sol Dexter for two hair ribbons, one to
match the sunrise and one like the green in the hollow
of a wave just before it turns over when the sun
is shining on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queerest gal, that!&rdquo; Mrs. Dexter confided to her
husband, Cap&rsquo;n Sol, the next time he came in from
one of his sea &ldquo;v&rsquo;yages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must get all them sunset notions from her
pa&rsquo;s side. I recollect hearin&rsquo; he was an artist
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; the good-natured man had replied, &ldquo;if
that pore gal gets any comfort out&rsquo;n &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;m sure
sartin glad. She&rsquo;s little more&rsquo;n a prisoner most o&rsquo;
the year over thar on Windy Island. Jest because
her ma ran off &rsquo;n&rsquo; married up wi&rsquo; that city feller, ol&rsquo;
Ezry Bassett is tarnal sartin the same thing&rsquo;ll happen
to Rilly. But I cal&rsquo;late them thar city fellars,
on the whole, ain&rsquo;t hankerin&rsquo; to splice up with lighthouse
keepers&rsquo; gals nor grand-gals, neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Rilla had reached home that never-to-be-forgotten
day when she had purchased something
all by herself and for the very first time, she had
slipped up to her room with the broken mirror and
she had tied on both of the new hair ribbons, one
red and one green. They weren&rsquo;t the shades that she
had really wanted, but they were the prettiest that
Mrs. Sol Dexter had in stock. Then she gazed long
at her reflection in the mirror. Once&mdash;just once&mdash;her
grand-dad had told her that she was the &ldquo;splittin&rsquo;
image&rdquo; of her mother, who had died when she
was only seventeen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve allays wished as I had a photygraf of her,&rdquo;
Rilla had thought. &ldquo;Now I can be lookin&rsquo; in the
mirror an&rsquo; pretendin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a picture of my mother,
only <i>she&rsquo;d</i> be lots sweeter lookin&rsquo;. Mrs. Sol Dexter
said as how the summer folks called <i>her</i> beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was always a wistful, yearning expression
in the hazel eyes of the girl when she thought of her
mother.</p>
<p>But all this had happened the autumn before. Bad
luck had <i>not</i> befallen Rilla&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t even know
that a broken mirror was supposed to bring bad
luck&mdash;and that is probably why it had not done so;
for we get, in this world, what we expect very often,
and this little lass, who lived so close to nature, was
always expecting something wonderful to happen
and she found real joy in the simplest things.</p>
<p>The dog, lying just outside the door, lifted a
listening ear the moment his little mistress had
stepped out of bed and he was eagerly waiting when
she softly opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! Shagsie, ol&rsquo; dog, don&rsquo; be barkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the girl
cautioned. &ldquo;Grand-dad&rsquo;s put the light out an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
gone back to his bunk for &rsquo;nother forty winks.
You&rsquo;n I&rsquo;ll have time to see what&rsquo;s in the box. Sh-h!
Soft now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>The dog&rsquo;s intelligent brown eyes were watching
the face of his mistress and he seemed to understand
that he must be very quiet. If Muriel tiptoed
as she went down the curving flight of steps to the
kitchen, so too did Shags. As she passed the door
of her grand-dad&rsquo;s bedroom she could hear his even
breathing.</p>
<p>It was not unusual for Rilla and Shags to climb to
the top of the crags to watch the sunrise, and so,
even if her grandfather had awakened, he would
have thought nothing of it, but it was not to the
highest point of the cliff that the girl went.</p>
<p>Instead, she clambered down what appeared to be
a perilous descent, but both she and the dog were as
sure-footed as mountain goats, and they were soon
standing on the out-jutting ledge in front of a small
opening which was the entrance to her Treasure
Cave.</p>
<p>Eager as the girl was to learn the secret that the
box contained, she did not go in at once, but paused,
turning toward the sea. The waves, lifting snowy
crests, caught the dawning glory of the sky. Impulsively
she stretched her arms out to the sun.</p>
<p>There was something sacred to this untaught girl
about the rebirth of each day, and the glory of the
sky and sea was reflected in her radiant upturned
face. Only for a brief while did the pageantry last,
and the world&mdash;Rilla&rsquo;s world, all that she knew&mdash;was
again attired in its everyday garb, sky-blue, sea-green,
rock-grey, while over all was the shining sun-gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Stooping, for the cave door was too small to be
entered by so tall a girl were she standing erect,
Rilla disappeared from the ledge and Shags followed
her. The cave within was larger than one
might suppose, and was lighted by wide crevices
here and there in its wall of rocks through which
rays of sunlight slanted. The continuous roar of
the surf, crashing on the rocks below, was somewhat
dulled.</p>
<p>Rilla leaped forward with a little cry of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shags,&rdquo; she called gleefully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s still here!
&rsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a dream-box arter all. I sort o&rsquo; got to
thinkin&rsquo; in the night it might be.&rdquo; She clapped her
hands, for there were moments when Rilla was a
very little girl at heart, much younger than her
years, and yet at other times, when she was comforting
her old grand-dad and soothing away his
imaginary fears, she was far older than fifteen.</p>
<p>Shags was now permitted to bark his excitement,
which he did, capering in puppy fashion about the
banded box of foreign appearance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>The girl looked at it with her head on one side.
&ldquo;How in time are we to get into it, ol&rsquo; dog?&rdquo; she
inquired as she stooped to examine the box. &ldquo;&rsquo;Pears
like we&rsquo;ll have to smash it. Here yo&rsquo;, Shags, what&rsquo;s
that tag-end yer tuggin&rsquo; on? Yo-o! It&rsquo;s the answer
to the riddle, like&rsquo;s not! That strap&rsquo;s got a
buckle on it, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s mate&rsquo;s the same. Heave ho!
Open she comes. Easy as sailin&rsquo; down stream.&rdquo;
As the girl spoke she lifted the cover of the box and
uttered a cry of mingled joy and amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thunder sakes! Tarnell!&rdquo; she ejaculated, unconsciously
using both of her grandfather&rsquo;s favorite
exclamations at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shagsie, ol&rsquo; dog, will you be lookin&rsquo;! There&rsquo;s a
mirror inside the cover as hasn&rsquo;t a crack in it. Yo-o!
It comes out. There now, stood up it&rsquo;s as tall as I
am.&rdquo; As the girl talked to her interested companion
she lifted the mirror-lined cover and placed it against
the wall of the cave. Meanwhile the curious dog
was dragging something from the box. Rilla
leaped forward to rescue whatever it might be. &ldquo;Lie
down, sir, and mind orders,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
skipper o&rsquo; this craft.&rdquo; After rescuing the mysterious
something which the dog had evidently considered
his rightful share of the booty, the girl knelt
and examined the contents of the box. She then
turned glowing eyes toward her comrade, who had
minded her and was watching her intently, his head
low on his outstretched paws. &ldquo;Land a Goshen!&rdquo;
she ejaculated. &ldquo;Shagsie, ol&rsquo; dog, what&rsquo;d yo&rsquo; think?
This here box is full o&rsquo; riggin&rsquo;s for a fine lady such
as comes from the city for the summer, &rsquo;pears like,
though I&rsquo;ve never seen &rsquo;em close to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Awed, and hardly able to believe her eyes, Rilla
lifted a truly wonderful garment from the trunk&mdash;it
was silk&mdash;and green, sea-green like the heart of a
wave just before its foamy crest curls over in the
sun.</p>
<p>It was trimmed with silvery, spangly lace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dress to wear, &rsquo;pears like, though thar&rsquo;s
not much to it as yo&rsquo; could call sleeves, an&rsquo;, yo-o!
Shagsie, will yo&rsquo; look? Here&rsquo;s slipper things! Soft
as the moss on the nor&rsquo;east side o&rsquo; a rock an&rsquo; green,
wi&rsquo; silver buckles.&rdquo; Then the girl&rsquo;s excited, merry
laughter rang out as she drew forth another treasure.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo; tell me yo&rsquo; don&rsquo; know what this here
is, Shagsie,&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;Maybe yo&rsquo; think it&rsquo;s
a green spider-web, but &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t; no, sir, it&rsquo;s got a heel
and a toe to it! That&rsquo;s a stockin&rsquo;, ol&rsquo; dog. Now,
who&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She paused and listened intently.
Ringing clear above the booming crash of the surf
she heard her grand-dad calling. Quickly she ran
to the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rilly gal, tarnation sakes, whar be you? Never
seem to be around mess time lately. The kettle&rsquo;s
singin&rsquo; like a tipsy sailor and &rsquo;bout to dance its cap
off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo;, Grand-dad,&rdquo; the girl thrust her head out
to reply, in a quieter moment, when a wave was receding;
then hastily, but with infinite care, she knelt
and smoothed the silken folds of the shimmering
green gown, replaced the mirror-lined top, strapped
it down and then covered the whole with an old sail
cloth which had been one of Rilla&rsquo;s former stowed-away
treasures.</p>
<p>If the girl had been excited the night before, she
was much more so this early morning. However,
her grand-dad was preoccupied and did not notice
the flushed cheeks and eager, glowing eyes of his
&ldquo;fust mate.&rdquo; Silently he ate his quarter of apple
pie, gulped down a huge cup of steaming coffee. It
was plain to the girl who watched him that he was
thinking of something intently.</p>
<p>Rilla was counting the minutes that would have
to elapse before she revisited the cave, when her
grand-dad pushed his armchair back from the table
and arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rilly gal,&rdquo; he peered over his spectacles at the
girl, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to navigate to town this mornin&rsquo;. Oil
and supplies are gettin&rsquo; tarnicky low, &rsquo;pears like.
Equinoxial storms are due in port mos&rsquo; any day now,
so we&rsquo;ll not put the v&rsquo;yage off any longer. Fust
mate, be gettin&rsquo; into yer sea-goin&rsquo; togs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s heart sank. &ldquo;Oh, Grand-daddy, do I
<i>have</i> to go?&rdquo; The piercing grey eyes under shaggy
brows turned toward the girl questioningly. Had
he heard aright? Could it be <i>his</i> &ldquo;gal&rdquo; begging <i>not</i>
to be taken to town, when usually it was right the
other way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Then he laughed. &ldquo;What a suspicious ol&rsquo; sea-dog
I am,&rdquo; he ruminated. &ldquo;Mabbe the gal&rsquo;s rigged up
some new fancy notion down in that cave o&rsquo; her&rsquo;n.&rdquo;
Aloud he said heartily. &ldquo;All right, fust mate, stay
anchored if ye want to. I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; thar&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;
on Windy Island to molest ye. Thar&rsquo;s the gun in
the corner if yer needin&rsquo; it, but Shags, here, will
protect ye, won&rsquo;t ye, ol&rsquo; skipper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog leaped alongside as the old man went
down the steep, wet stairs that led to the wharf, near
which a dory was floating.</p>
<p>The girl stood in the open door, and with shaded
eyes watched the scudding sailboat until, as was his
custom, her grand-dad turned to wave to her as he
passed the first buoy.</p>
<p>There were many buoys, painted in varying
bright colors, that the skipper of each incoming
fishing smack might have no trouble in locating his
own particular mooring place. On a moonlighted
night, when the sailing boats were all in, it was
indeed a pretty sight to see the flotilla, some newly
painted and others weather-stained, bobbing on the
choppy waters of the bay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Windy Island, though only a quarter of a mile
wide, was nearly a mile long, and protected one of
the snuggest little harbors to be found along that
wild, rugged coast.</p>
<p>As soon as the kitchen was shipshape, Muriel raced
toward the outer edge of the cliff, calling &ldquo;Yo-o,
come on, Shagsie, ol&rsquo; dog. We&rsquo;ll cruise back to the
cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rilla did not enter her Treasure Cave again
that day, for in another moment, and quite unexpectedly,
she was launched upon her very first real
adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III.
<br />A FIRST ADVENTURE.</h2>
<p>Muriel did not have to call a second time to her
shaggy friend, for up the steep, wet steps from the
wharf the dog leaped and lifted intelligent, inquiring
eyes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo; let&rsquo;s go to the cave fust off, Shagsie.&rdquo;
The girl always talked to her four-footed companion
as though she were sure that he could understand.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to that pebbly beach war yo&rsquo; found suthin&rsquo;
yesterday an&rsquo; lost it. Mabbe it got washed up shore
agin, whatever &rsquo;twas. Mabbe now! What say, ol&rsquo;
Shags?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing that a reply was expected when his mistress
stooped and stroked his head, the dog yapped
eagerly, then raced alongside of the barefooted girl,
who followed an infrequently used trail which
ambled along toward the north end of the island,
where the beach was wildest.</p>
<p>The shore, however, could not be seen until one
was nearly upon it. When it came within the vision
of the girl she stood still so suddenly that Shags,
having kept on, was several lengths ahead before he
was conscious that he was alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>He turned back inquiringly. &ldquo;Sh! Keep still!&rdquo;
the girl whispered, her hazel eyes growing darker
and wider as she gazed, almost as though she were
frightened at something just below on the rocky
beach.</p>
<p>What she saw was not really fear-inspiring. A
youth, dressed in white flannels, who appeared to be
but little older than Rilla, was standing with his
hands in his pockets gazing at a flat-bottomed,
weather-stained sailboat, in which he had evidently
just landed and which he had drawn as high as he
could up on the shore.</p>
<p>He turned with a start when an angry voice called,
<a id="rfront" href="#front">&ldquo;Clear out! Go away! We don&rsquo; want any landlubbers here!&rdquo;</a></p>
<p>The lad, however, did not seem to be in the least
intimidated by this outburst from the rocks above
him.</p>
<p>Looking up, he actually smiled. A barefooted
girl with red-brown hair blowing in the wind and
with a shaggy yellow and white dog at her side was,
to his thought, a picture more to be admired than
feared.</p>
<p>And, for that matter, Eugene Beavers, himself,
was not fear-inspiring. He had clear grey eyes, a
keen, thin face, and a firmly rounded chin. Indeed,
Gene, as his best friends called him, was not only a
good looking lad but one whom young and old
trusted unquestioningly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>But with Rilla one thought was uppermost. One
of those terrible creatures so dreaded by her grand-dad
had dared to land on her very own island.
There could be no mistake that he was &ldquo;city folks,&rdquo;
for no boy living on the coast would have such a
pale face nor would he be dressed in white flannels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If yo&rsquo; don&rsquo; board yer boat an&rsquo; ship off instanter
I&rsquo;ll send Shags at yo&rsquo;, I will!&rdquo; Rilla was wrathful
because her first command had not been obeyed. At
this the lad laughed, not rudely, but with merry
good nature. It seemed to him truly humorous that
this barefooted, wind-blown girl should be ordering
him out to sea. Rilla, however, believed that he was
laughing at her. Stamping her foot and pointing
at the boy, her eyes flashing, she cried, &ldquo;Shags, at
him, ol&rsquo; dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faithful creature plunged down the rocky
trail, growling as fiercely as he could, but as he approached
the youth toward whom his mistress was
pointing he paused uncertainly. The smiling lad,
unafraid, was holding out a welcoming hand. &ldquo;Come
here, good dog,&rdquo; he said coaxingly.</p>
<p>Shags, being friendly by nature, and not in the
least understanding the present need for ferocity,
actually wagged his tail and permitted the strange
boy to stroke his head. This was too much for
Rilla.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Her grand-dad had said that the dog would protect
her, but he hadn&rsquo;t done it. With an angry half
sob, she turned and scrambled up the rocks. A second
later, when the boy looked up, the girl was not
to be seen. Shrugging his shoulders, he turned
back to converse with his newly acquired companion.
Gene dearly loved dogs and Shags had instinctively
recognized in him a friend, but not so Rilla. She
was convinced that all boys from the city were
enemies, for had not her grand-dad said so time
and again?</p>
<p>Running to the lighthouse, the girl seized the gun
that stood in the corner and raced back again. The
next time that Gene Beavers looked up, there she
stood with a gun pointed directly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;ll yo&rsquo; take orders?&rdquo; her voice rang out
angrily, her eyes dark with excitement. &ldquo;Now&rsquo;ll yo&rsquo;
put out to sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad looked puzzled and then troubled. For
the first time he was conscious that this stormy
girl really feared him, and yet he could not get near
enough to explain to her why he had landed on
Windy Island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>What should he do? What could he do? Rilla
said no more, but, while he was hesitating, there was
a sudden report and a bullet whizzed over his head.
It was evidently merely a choice between which
kind of an end to his life he preferred. Pushing the
boat into the water in a quiet, rock-sheltered spot, he
leaped in and shoved off.</p>
<p>However, he had not gone two lengths from
shore when he heard the girl shouting lustily:
&ldquo;Come back here, yo&rsquo; landlubber! Don&rsquo; yo&rsquo; know
yer boat&rsquo;s sinkin&rsquo;? Tarnation sakes, what kind o&rsquo;
an old hulk yo&rsquo; got thar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gun had been thrown down and the girl
scrambled down to the edge of the beach. The boat,
having left the shelter of the rocks, was caught in
the surf. Seizing the oars, Gene let the sail flap as
he tried to regain the land. The leak which had
driven him to shore in the beginning was causing
the boat to rapidly fill with water. Then, to complete
his feeling of helplessness, an unusually large
breaker was thundering toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump the gunnel, quick, or yo&rsquo;ll flounder!&rdquo; the
girl commanded.</p>
<p>The lad obeyed. Leaping into the swirling water,
which was nearly chin deep, he swam toward the
shore, and not a moment too soon, for the breaker
lifted the boat high and crashed it to splinters on
the rocky point.</p>
<p>The boy and the girl stood near each other watching
the annihilation of the craft and the angry after-swirl
of dark green waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Then, turning to his companion, he smiled. &ldquo;Well,
little Miss Storm Maiden,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have saved
my life, I guess, by your quick command, although
you really wanted to shoot me, since your dog
wouldn&rsquo;t eat me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d yo&rsquo; know my name was Storm?&rdquo; the
truly amazed girl inquired. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t tol&rsquo; yo&rsquo;
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it. Is that your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. &ldquo;Ye-ah! Muriel Storm, though
Grand-dad calls me Rilly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; the boy told her, &ldquo;is Eugene Beavers,
and my friends call me Gene. My home is in New
York, but I am visiting your Doctor Winslow in
Tunkett. He and my dad are old friends. I&rsquo;ve been
sick and had to leave college right at the beginning
of the term, so dad shipped me off down here
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could finish his sentence, Muriel, who
had been looking at him steadily, exclaimed: &ldquo;Yer
shiverin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the cold. The surf&rsquo;s like ice. Yo&rsquo; be
gathering driftwood for a fire; make a tarnal whopper,
while I get some matches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the girl scrambled up the trail among the
rocks and the dog went with her. For a moment
the lad stood gazing out at sea, as he ruminated, an
amused twinkle in his eyes:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And here I thought that Tunkett at this time of
the year would be stupid, the summer colony being
closed, but I never had an adventure more interesting
than this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gene had a goodly pile of driftwood collected
when Rilla reappeared on the rocky cliff. Instead
of the gun, she was carrying a covered bucket and
a thick china cup.</p>
<p>Although her manner of approaching him could
not really be called friendly, yet it was not as hostile
as her former attitude had been. She held up the
cup toward him and filled it with steaming hot tea.
&ldquo;Drink that!&rdquo; she commanded; then added, &ldquo;Though
likely &rsquo;twill mos&rsquo; scald yo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How the lad wanted to laugh. Just before he
had left the city his sister Helen had dragged him to
an afternoon tea (or was it a bazaar?) and there
some prettily dressed girls had surrounded him,
offering him dainty porcelain cups half filled with
fragrant orange pekoe. He was expected to purchase
one of them for the sake of the cause. Not
wishing to offend any of the fair friends of Helen
Beavers, he had purchased them all, and then, when
unobserved, he had slipped away to freedom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Again a maiden&mdash;a storm maiden, at that&mdash;was
offering him tea. The cup wasn&rsquo;t porcelain and the
girl was not effusively gracious to him as those
others, who all greatly admired him, had been. This
wild island girl was merely trying to warm him up
that he need not freeze from his unexpected plunge
into the icy surf. There was another point of difference
between the two tea parties, Gene thought
as he drank the hot, and almost bitter, beverage.
His one desire at the other had been to escape, but
at this tea party he found himself more interested
than he had been in a long time.</p>
<p>Gene had several moments alone in which to meditate,
for Rilla, having glanced at the sun, had suddenly
scrambled up the rocks, and, shading her eyes,
had looked long toward the town. Being satisfied
that her grand-dad had not left Tunkett, she returned
and lighted the dry wood, which soon
snapped and crackled. Then, rising, she put her
hands on her hips and unsmilingly gazed at the boy
with dark, expressive eyes. After a moment&rsquo;s
solemn scrutiny she inquired: &ldquo;How come yo&rsquo; to
be cruisin&rsquo; &rsquo;round in that ol&rsquo; leaky hulk? Even a
water rat&rsquo;d had better sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed to the lad to be a note of scorn in
the girl&rsquo;s voice, and yet she had brought him tea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Gene lowered the cup and smiled at her. Usually
his smile was contagious, it was so genuinely good
natured. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you in the least for calling
me names,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I just landed in Tunkett
yesterday, and not knowing how to pass the time
away, I went down to the wharf and asked a small
freckle-faced boy if I could hire a boat. He said I
could have my pick for a dollar an hour. He was
going with me to where his boats were tied, I suppose,
but just then some woman in the store called
and away he ran. So I took the first boat I came
to. I didn&rsquo;t notice that it leaked until I was rounding
the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was little Sol&mdash;Mis&rsquo; Dexter&rsquo;s boy&mdash;he
rents boats to summer folks. He asks a tarnal
whoppin&rsquo; price for &rsquo;em, &rsquo;pears like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, his sail will cost me more than one dollar,&rdquo;
the lad told her, his eyes twinkling, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ll
have to pay for the wreck, I suppose.&rdquo; Then he
added: &ldquo;Miss Storm Maiden, why don&rsquo;t you
smile? I&rsquo;ve been here an hour, I do believe, and
although you have looked at me angrily and scornfully
and solemnly, you have not as yet smiled at
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be smilin&rsquo; when I know I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; what&rsquo;s
agin my grand-dad&rsquo;s orders, but I <i>tried</i> to mind
him. I tried to ship yo&rsquo; off&rsquo;n Windy Island. I
sure did.&rdquo; The lad was puzzled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll testify that
you tried hard enough, but <i>why</i> did you, Storm
Maiden? Surely you weren&rsquo;t afraid of me. I don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in a few words, the girl told of her grand-dad&rsquo;s
dislike for &ldquo;city folks,&rdquo; though she did not tell
him what caused that dislike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I the very first boy you have ever talked
with?&rdquo; the lad asked in amazement.</p>
<p>Rilla, still solemn, nodded. &ldquo;Ye-ah,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m tarnal sartin I don&rsquo; know what to do with
yo&rsquo;, bein&rsquo; as yer boat&rsquo;s wrecked. Grand-dad&rsquo;ll be
back by noon and it&rsquo;s most that now.&rdquo; A swift
glance at the sun had told Rilla the time. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo;ll
have to hide in Treasure Cave, that&rsquo;s what! I can&rsquo;t
come to see yo&rsquo; thar; &rsquo;twouldn&rsquo;t be honest to Grand-dad;
but I&rsquo;ll let down a basket of grub on a rope.
Then, when Cap&rsquo;n Barney comes in from the fishin&rsquo;
shoals where he goes every day I&rsquo;ll hail him an&rsquo; tell
him to take yo&rsquo; to town. He don&rsquo; mind city folks
the way Grand-dad does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she talked, Rilla led the way along the shore
and paused at the foot of the perilous cliff above
which towered the lighthouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a sail cloth in the cave as yo&rsquo; can wrap
up in and keep warm,&rdquo; she said. Then she pointed
out the steep trail.</p>
<p>The lad looked at it and secretly wondered if he
could make it. Then, turning, he held out his right
hand, his cap in the other, as he said earnestly:
&ldquo;Miss Muriel Storm, I thank you for everything.&rdquo;
Then he started to climb. The girl watched him
anxiously. &ldquo;Steady there!&rdquo; she cautioned. &ldquo;Keep
an even keel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>The lad reached the ledge in safety and turned to
wave his cap; then, stooping, he entered the cave,
and none too soon, for, right at that very moment,
a stentorian voice from the top of the cliff called,
&ldquo;Rilly gal, where be ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo;, Grand-dad!&rdquo; the girl replied. Then she
raced along the strip of pebbly beach, the dog at her
heels.</p>
<p>Rilla&rsquo;s heart was pounding with tumultuous excitement.
How she wished that she could go to her
grandfather and tell him the whole truth, but she
did not dare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV.
<br />A SHIPWRECKED MARINER.</h2>
<p>Cap&rsquo;n Ezra Bassett was removing his rubber
boots when Rilla entered the room. The tea kettle
was singing cheerily on the stove. She had refilled
it when she had made tea for Gene.</p>
<p>Again the old man noticed the flushed, excited
appearance of the girl. &ldquo;Rilla gal,&rdquo; he said as he
tugged at one boot, &ldquo;what in tarnation have you got
stowed away in that cave o&rsquo; yourn that you&rsquo;re so
plumb interested in? I swan I can&rsquo;t figger it out.
Maybe I&rsquo;d better take a cruise down that way and be
inspectin&rsquo; below decks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luckily Rilla&rsquo;s back was turned as she hurriedly
pared potatoes for the frying. If her grand-dad had
seen her face at that moment his suspicions would
indeed have been aroused. When she did turn with
the black iron spider to put upon the stove, she was
greatly relieved to see that the old captain was removing
his second boot and that he did not mean to
carry out his threat to visit the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Grand-dad,&rdquo; she began, hoping to lead his
thoughts into other channels, &ldquo;was thar anythin&rsquo;
new as yo&rsquo; heard of in town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One might have supposed by his sudden explosive
ejaculation that the new channel into which his
thoughts had turned was not a pleasant one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-ah, by thunder!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One of those
good-for-nothin&rsquo; city fellars landed in Tunkett last
night, so Mis&rsquo; Sol was sayin&rsquo;, though what he&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;
&rsquo;round here at this time o&rsquo; the year nobody knows.
I sure sartin was plaguey glad yo&rsquo;d stayed anchored
here on Windy Island. I don&rsquo;t want yo&rsquo; to run
afoul of any city folks&mdash;gals neither&mdash;with hifalutin&rsquo;
notions; they&rsquo;re all a parcel o&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s
speech was interrupted by a crash. Rilla had
dropped a dish, an unheard-of proceeding, for she
was as sure-fingered as she was sure-footed usually.
Luckily the china was thick and apparently unbreakable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grub&rsquo;s ready, Grand-dad,&rdquo; she said, as she
poured into his cup the strong, steaming tea. The
old man was pleased to note how little interest his
&ldquo;gal&rdquo; took in the despised city folks, and he beamed
across the table at her as he continued: &ldquo;Sho now,
Rilly, here&rsquo;s some news on a dif&rsquo;rent tack. Cap&rsquo;n
Barney&rsquo;s laid up in drydock with rheumatics. Like&rsquo;s
not he won&rsquo;t be able to navigate that craft o&rsquo; his for
a week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face paled. &ldquo;Oh, Grand-dad, I&rsquo;m that
sorry,&rdquo; she said, but her thought was inquired:
&ldquo;How can that city chap get to the mainland if Cap&rsquo;n
Barney don&rsquo; take him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rilla had no other intimate friends among the
fishermen who would be passing that evening on
their homeward way from the Outer Ledge where
they went at dawn each day after cod.</p>
<p>Captain Barney she loved next to her grand-dad,
for had he not helped bring her up? One of her
earliest recollections was of that kindly Irishman
holding her on his knee and telling her wonderful
tales of fairy folk who lived on that far away and
dearly loved Emerald Isle where his boyhood had
been spent. Never had the girl wearied of listening
to tales of the mermaids who dwelt in caves under
the cliffs and of the &ldquo;Little Folk&rdquo; who went about
among the peat cabins helping the peasants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But thar&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; the loike of thim over here,&rdquo;
old Cap&rsquo;n Barney would end, with a sigh, &ldquo;lest be
it&rsquo;s you, Rilly lass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the noon meal was over, Captain Ezra
pushed back his chair. &ldquo;Wall, fust mate, I reckon
I&rsquo;ll cruise down to the shanty for a spell an&rsquo; overhaul
the kit. Holler if ye need me.&rdquo; Rilla, with rapidly
beating heart, stood in the open door and watched
her grand-dad as he slowly descended the steep stairs
leading to the little wharf near which bobbed the
anchored dory. About twenty feet up the beach was
the shanty in which Cap&rsquo;n Ezra kept his fishing
tackle and the supplies for the lighthouse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>It was hard indeed for the girl, who was as honest
as old Cap&rsquo;n Ezra himself, to be doing something of
which her grand-dad would disapprove, and yet she
couldn&rsquo;t let a boy starve even if he had come from
the city.</p>
<p>Quickly she filled a basket with food and tied it
firmly to one end of a long rope. Going to the edge
of the cliff, back of the lighthouse, she called &ldquo;Yo-o!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy appeared and stood on the ledge looking
up. He waved his cap in greeting and then, catching
the swinging basket, he untied it.</p>
<p>Rilla drew up the rope and let down a pail of tea;
then she knelt and leaning over as far as she could
with safety she called: &ldquo;Like&rsquo;s not you&rsquo;ll have to
bunk thar all night. Cap&rsquo;n Barney didn&rsquo;t go fishin&rsquo;
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, before Gene could question her concerning
some other manner of reaching the mainland, the
girl disappeared.</p>
<p>The boy laughed as he re-entered the cave. &ldquo;Robinson
Crusoe&rsquo;s island was not half as interesting as
this one,&rdquo; he thought as he ate with a relish the
homely fare which the basket contained. He had
not realized that he was ravenously hungry. When
the feast was over, the lad rose and looked long out
at sea, trying to discover the approach of a boat that
might be signaled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>He knew that if he did not soon return to Tunkett
his host, Doctor Winslow, would become alarmed.
Too, he was constantly on the alert for the possible
approach of Rilla&rsquo;s grandfather. &ldquo;What an old ogre
he must be,&rdquo; the lad thought, &ldquo;if his grand-daughter
is afraid to tell him of the near presence of a shipwrecked
mariner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the hours slipped by and no boat came within
signaling distance, Gene was tempted to walk boldly
out from his hiding place and tell the keeper of the
light that he wished to be taken to town, but the
&ldquo;storm maiden&rdquo; had seemed so truly distressed at
the mere thought that her grandfather might learn
of the presence of a &ldquo;city boy&rdquo; on Windy Island
that, out of chivalry, he decided to heed her wishes.</p>
<p>Muriel had just replaced the rope in the toolhouse
when she heard her grandfather&rsquo;s voice booming
from the foot of the steep stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-ah, Grand-dad, I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; the girl replied,
wondering what was wanted of her. Could he have
seen her taking the basket of food to the cave, she
questioned. But, since he was still on the lower
shore farthest from the cliff, this was not possible.
She found the old man busily mending a net which
was stretched out on the sand in front of the shanty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rilly gal,&rdquo; he said, smiling up at her, &ldquo;thar&rsquo;s a
tarnation lot o&rsquo; tears in this ol&rsquo; net. Have you time,
fust mate, to be helpin&rsquo; with the mendin&rsquo; of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have, Grand-dad. All the time there is
till sundown,&rdquo; Muriel replied, almost eagerly. The
girl&rsquo;s conscience had been making her very unhappy.
It was the first time in the fifteen years they had
spent together that Muriel had kept anything from
her grandfather. Every little, unimportant thing
which had occurred during the almost uneventful
days had been talked over with him and the old man
would not have believed it possible for his &ldquo;gal&rdquo;
to have been secretive, and yet, during the three
hours that followed while these two sat on low stools
mending the many tears in the net, Cap&rsquo;n Ezra
glanced often across at the girl, who, with bent head
and flushed cheeks, was working industriously.
Never before had he known his &ldquo;gal&rdquo; to be so silent.
Usually her happy chatter was constant when they
were working together. The shaggy grey brows
were almost unconsciously contracted and the heart
of the old man was troubled. At last, rising, he
went around and stood beside his grand-daughter.
Placing a hand upon her bent head, he asked kindly,
&ldquo;Fust mate, tell me all about it. Tell your ol&rsquo; grand-dad
what&rsquo;s troublin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;. Have yo&rsquo; run afoul, Rilly
gal, of anything that&rsquo;s hurt yo&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>The hazel eyes that were lifted were clear in their
gaze. &ldquo;No, Grand-dad, not that,&rdquo; she replied. Then,
as she said no more, but bent again over her task,
the old man, with folded arms, stood, gazing long
across the shimmering waters and toward the town.
When he spoke there was almost a wistful note in
his voice. &ldquo;Barney&rsquo;s been tellin&rsquo; me that I&rsquo;m not
doin&rsquo; right by yo&rsquo;, Rilly gal,&rdquo; the old man began.
&ldquo;He was sayin&rsquo; that I should be sendin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; away to
school to educate yo&rsquo;, like other gals. Is that what&rsquo;s
a-troublin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;, fust mate? Are yo&rsquo; hankerin&rsquo; to
leave yer ol&rsquo; grand-dad and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could say no more, for the girl, having leaped
to her feet, clasped her hands over his mouth.
&ldquo;Grand-dad,&rdquo; she lovingly rebuked him, &ldquo;how can
yo&rsquo; be askin&rsquo; that? Didn&rsquo;t I promise I&rsquo;d never be
leavin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;? I don&rsquo;t want to go. I&rsquo;d be skeered,
like&rsquo;s not, all alone in the big world. I want to allays
stay anchored here in the safe harbor of yer love,
Grand-dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl had slipped around and nestled in the
arms of the old man, lifting eyes that were brimmed
with unshed tears.</p>
<p>There she was held so close, so sheltered, and
when at last Cap&rsquo;n Ezra spoke he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what set me to thinkin&rsquo; of all this, lest &rsquo;twas that
Barney said that gals had a natural hankerin&rsquo; for
young folks, an&rsquo; I s&rsquo;pose maybe they have. It&rsquo;s like
pairin&rsquo; off a gay little pleasure yacht with an ol&rsquo;
weather-stained hulk that&rsquo;s most ready to sink,
an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grand-dad, don&rsquo;t be talkin&rsquo; that way,&rdquo; the
girl implored. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to live as long as I do.
I couldn&rsquo;t be livin&rsquo; without yo.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man tried to laugh naturally. &ldquo;What a
pair of loons we be,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;trying to sink a ship
afore it strikes a shoal, seems like.&rdquo; He was rebuking
himself for having made his &ldquo;gal&rdquo; cry.</p>
<p>They were soon busy again at the mending, but,
although Rilla tried to chatter as was her wont, the
old man often found his thoughts wandering. At
last he said, &ldquo;Most sundown, fust mate. Time for
mess, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that evening Rilla&rsquo;s thoughts were with Gene
Beavers. She had not found another opportunity to
slip away to take food to him and yet the basket she
had taken at noon had contained enough for the day.</p>
<p>That night, when she knelt by her open window,
her prayer was not only for her grand-dad, and for
the father who never came, but also for her old
friend, Cap&rsquo;n Barney, and for her new friend, Gene
Beavers.</p>
<p>Her last waking thought was that in the morning
she would go to her grand-dad and tell him all that
had happened and that never, just never again, would
she deceive him. Then with a happier heart she fell
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V.
<br />A SWIM IN THE NIGHT.</h2>
<p>Meanwhile Gene Beavers had seated himself
upon the ledge of rocks below the cave and had
waited, now and then glancing up, hoping that the
&ldquo;storm maiden&rdquo; might appear with a message for
him, but the afternoon hours dragged away and she
did not come. Then, at last, to his joy, he saw that
the fishing boats were, one by one, leaving the Outer
Ledge and sailing toward home. Scrambling down
the steep cliff trail, the lad ran along the beach and
went far out on the rocky point. There he stood
eagerly awaiting the approach of the boats, ready,
when he believed that he was observed, to signal to
them. But, because of the direction of the wind
and the lowness of the tide, the fishing boats gave
Windy Island a wide berth. One boat did turn on
a tack and for a moment seemed to be bearing directly
toward the point. Taking off his white coat,
Gene waved it frantically, but the lone fisherman
was busy with the ropes just then and did not look
up. A second later the boat swung about on another
tack and Gene realized, with a sinking heart, that
he could depend no longer upon the fishermen to take
him to the mainland.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Walking slowly around the island, he stopped suddenly,
for he had heard voices not far ahead of him.
Quickly he stepped behind a sheltering boulder, and
none too soon, for it was at that moment that Cap&rsquo;n
Ezra had risen and had announced that it was
nearly sundown and time for the evening meal.
From his hiding place Gene observed all that happened.
He noted how troubled was the truly beautiful
face of his &ldquo;storm maiden.&rdquo; Perhaps she was
anxious about him. He almost hoped that she was.</p>
<p>The net was put away in the shanty and the old
man followed the girl up the steep steps. Some
time elapsed before Gene stepped out from his hiding
place. Walking out upon the small wharf, the
lad stood looking at the dory which was anchored
nearby. If only he could borrow that boat, he
thought. He could row to town and hire someone
to tow it back. But even this he could not do
without appealing to Captain Ezra, who, a few moments
before, had shouldered the oars and carried
them up to the lighthouse.</p>
<p>As the lad stood gazing out over the water of the
harbor the afterglow of the sunset faded, the first
stars came out and dusk gathered about him. He
shivered, for the night air seemed suddenly chill and
damp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Until then Gene had not been greatly concerned
about his mishap, considering it rather in the light
of an interesting and novel adventure. His host,
Doctor Winslow, luckily, had planned being away
all of that day. &ldquo;When he returns his housekeeper,
Miss Brazilla Mullet, will inform him that I did not
appear for the mid-day meal, as I had assured her
that I would,&rdquo; Gene thought, &ldquo;and he will probably
be greatly alarmed. It will be easy enough to trace
me to the dock where I hired the boat at so early an
hour this morning, and as I did not return it, he will
naturally think that I have met with disaster. If
only I could make the mainland within the next hour
I might be able to save mine host much unnecessary
anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly a daring plan suggested itself.</p>
<p>The summer before, Gene had won the championship
of his athletic club in a two-mile handicap swimming
race. It was only one mile to Tunkett, and,
moreover, the wind, blowing gently in from sea,
would aid him greatly. Surely he could make it,
for, if he wearied, he could float on his back until
he was rested. Then another thought came to remind
him of his recent illness. Was it not to regain
his strength that he had come to Tunkett, having
left college at the beginning of the fall term? When
he had won that championship he had been in the
best of trim. Shrugging his shoulders, Gene Beavers
argued no more with himself. There seemed to be
no other alternative, and so, pulling off his shoes
and socks and throwing them to the beach with his
white flannel coat, he went to the end of the small
wharf and plunged in. As Rilla had said, the water
was icy cold, and the lad struck out vigorously to
keep warm. It never would do for him to have a
chill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>On and on he swam, now and then lifting his
head to assure himself that he was keeping a straight
course toward the town wharf, on the end of which
were three lights, two red and one white. How
glad he was to see them. The long, glimmering reflections
stretched toward him and yet they seemed
farther away than they had appeared from Windy
Island.</p>
<p>Gene was nearing the silent, shadowy anchored
fleet of fishing boats when he suddenly realized that
his strength was failing rapidly. If only he could
reach an unoccupied buoy which he saw bobbing not
far ahead of him.</p>
<p>For a moment he rested upon his back, but when
he tried to turn again that he might swim, he felt
too weak to make the effort. Then he was terrorized
with the sudden realization that the tide had
changed and that he was drifting slowly away from
the little fleet and out toward the open sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Gene made another herculean effort to turn over
and swim, and so great was his determination, he
did succeed. Luckily the rising night wind aided
him and just then a wave, larger than the others
lifted him on its rolling crest and hurled him up on
the cask-like buoy, and there he clung. He had little
hope of being able to long retain his hold, as his
fingers were numb with cold and his arms ached.
Too, he felt drowsy, or was it faint?</p>
<p>It was at that moment that his &ldquo;storm maiden&rdquo;
knelt in her open window, and looking toward the
starry heavens, asked God to care for her new
friend, Gene Beavers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the lad had surmised, Doctor
Winslow was searching for his guest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI.
<br />A SEARCHING PARTY.</h2>
<p>It was nearing midnight and the huge lamp in the
tower above the cliff was mechanically swinging in
its great iron frame, hurling its beacon rays far out
to sea, slowly, rythmically turning. For a brief moment
the Outer Ledge was revealed, deserted and
surf washed, then the almost even roll of waves were
illumined, their white crests flashing in the dazzle
of light, to be again engulfed in darkness. Slowly
the lamp turned toward the town, where the three
lanterns, two red and one white, still burned on the
end of the wharf to guide a homeward belated fisherman,
then the little fleet of fishing boats and the
cask-like buoy were for a moment revealed. The
summer colony of boarded-up cabins was next illumined;
too the low, rambling inn that would not be
opened for many months; then again the wide path
of light swung out to sea and started once more on
its circling sweep that would continue until dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>It was the custom of Captain Ezra to waken at
midnight to be sure that the mechanism of the lamp
was in perfect order. He was just descending the
spiral stairway after a visit of inspection when there
came an imperative pounding without.</p>
<p>Shags, sleeping outside of Rilla&rsquo;s door, heard it
and leaped to his feet with an ominous growl.</p>
<p>The girl, startled from slumber, sprang from her
bed and dressed quickly. She had often done this
before when a crashing thunder storm had awakened
her, and she wanted to be on watch with her grand-dad.
Her first conscious thought had been that the
expected equinoctial storms had come, but when the
knocking continued and a man&rsquo;s voice called, &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n
Ezra, quick! Open the hatch,&rdquo; a new fear clutched
at the heart of the girl.</p>
<p>Perhaps the summons had something to do with
Gene Beavers, the lad from the city. She had not
been able the evening before to hail him from the
top of the cliff, but surely he could have kept warm
if he wrapped well in the sail cloth, and there had
been food enough in the basket for two days at
least.</p>
<p>Muriel was soon hurrying down the short flight
of stairs that led from her small room above the
kitchen. Her grand-dad had already flung the door
wide open and there Rilla saw several longshoremen
in slickers and sou&rsquo;westers, who were carrying lanterns.
Doctor Winslow was in the lead, and his
white, drawn face plainly told how great his anxiety
had been.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lem, ol&rsquo; pal, what&rsquo;s gone wrong?&rdquo; Captain Ezra
inquired. He drew the physician, who had been a
friend of his boyhood, into the kitchen, which was
still warm, as the fire in the stove had but recently
died down and a few embers were burning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ez,&rdquo; Doctor Winslow began, when the men had
entered and closed the door, &ldquo;have you seen a young
boy, a chap about eighteen, sailing anywhere near
Windy Island today? You&rsquo;ve heard me speak of
Dan Beavers, who was a college mate of mine. Well,
this is his son. He came to Tunkett to try to regain
his strength after a serious illness. Truth is, he
ought not to have attempted to sail a boat alone. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have permitted it if I had been at home,
but I had several calls to make across the marshes,
and when I go there I make a day of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old sea captain was shaking his grizzled head
as his friend talked. &ldquo;No, Lem,&rdquo; he replied when
the other paused. &ldquo;I reckon yer off&rsquo;n yer bearin&rsquo;s,
I ain&rsquo;t sighted a city chap cruisin&rsquo; &rsquo;round in these
waters, not since the colony closed, but, for onct, I
wish I had, bein&rsquo; as it&rsquo;s some-un b&rsquo;longin&rsquo; to yo&rsquo;,
mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cry from Rilla caused them all to turn and look
at her as she stood in the open stair door. Running
to Doctor Winslow, she caught his hand. &ldquo;Uncle
Lem,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I know where he is, if it&rsquo;s a lad
named Gene Beavers that yo&rsquo;re wantin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Then, seeing the inquiring expression on the face
of Captain Ezra, she hurried on to explain: &ldquo;His
boat was wrecked, Grand-dad, that&rsquo;s how he come
to be here, but I didn&rsquo;t dare to tell yo&rsquo;, yo&rsquo;re that sot
agin city chaps. I didn&rsquo;t do anythin&rsquo; that yo&rsquo;
wouldn&rsquo;t want me to, Grand-dad. I didn&rsquo;t go near
the cave where he was, not once in all the afternoon.
Yo&rsquo; know I didn&rsquo;t, for I stayed right with yo&rsquo;
a-mendin&rsquo; the net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I figger yo&rsquo; did the best yo&rsquo; could, fust mate,&rdquo;
the old man replied; &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late it&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;s bungled
matters, makin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; skeered to come and tell things
straight out. But like&rsquo;s not we&rsquo;ll find the boy sleepin&rsquo;
in the cave. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s hang out distress signals
till we&rsquo;re sure we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to sink.&rdquo; As he talked he
put on his slicker and cap, as the night wind was
cold. Then, taking a lighted lantern, Cap&rsquo;n Ezra,
after bidding Rilla to liven up the fire and put the
kettle on, opened the door and led the way to the
top of the cliff. Making a trumpet of his hands, he
shouted: &ldquo;Ho, there, down below! Yo&rsquo;re wanted
up on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they waited, listening, but the crashing of
the surf was all that they heard. One of the younger
men who was used to scaling cliffs, however steep,
climbed down to the ledge and held his lantern so
that the small cave was illumined. After a moment&rsquo;s
scrutiny he called up to the anxious group:
&ldquo;Empty as an ol&rsquo; clam shell. Nothin&rsquo; in there but
a box an&rsquo; a sail cloth that&rsquo;s spread out flat an&rsquo; concealin&rsquo;
nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>When Muriel heard the men returning, she threw
open the door and her eager glance scanned the
group, hoping to find among them her new friend,
Gene Beavers. &ldquo;He wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t thar, fust mate,&rdquo; the
old sea captain said gloomily, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I figger it&rsquo;s all
my fault for bein&rsquo; so tarnal sot agin city chaps. I
reckoned, one bein&rsquo; a scoundrel, they all was, like&rsquo;s
not.&rdquo; Then, turning to Doctor Winslow, he added
with spirit: &ldquo;Lem, we won&rsquo;t give up yit. We&rsquo;ll
throw out a drag net if need be. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; along,
wherever yo&rsquo; cruise to. Rilly gal can tend to the
light for a spell. I couldn&rsquo;t rest easy if I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
tryin&rsquo; to help locate the lad. The heft of this trouble
comes from me being so tarnal sot about things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The physician placed a hand on his friend&rsquo;s shoulder.
&ldquo;Look here, Ez,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;neither you nor
Rilla are to blame. The lad has not used good
judgment, but older men than he is have failed in
that, now and then. You mustn&rsquo;t come with us. A
heavy fog is rolling in and you might be needed any
moment right here at the light. Some ship may
send in a distress signal and Rilla is only a little
girl, after all, only fifteen, and we mustn&rsquo;t ask her
to assume so serious a responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>While the physician was talking, the girl whom he
had called &ldquo;little&rdquo; was pouring the tea she had made
into four heavy cups and one of these she took to
Doctor Winslow, saying, &ldquo;Uncle Lem, drink this,
please do, &rsquo;fore you go out agin into the wet fog,
an&rsquo;, too, thar&rsquo;s a cup for each of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men seemed glad for the warmth of the beverage
and then, when the cups had been drained,
they started out, calling back that they would swing
the red lanterns in a circle three times from the end
of the town wharf if Gene Beavers was found that
night.</p>
<p>When they were gone, Rilla removed her grandfather&rsquo;s
slicker and he sank down in his armchair
and buried his face in his hands.</p>
<p>Muriel stood at his side, her arm about his neck,
not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>Reaching up, the old man clasped the girl&rsquo;s hand
in his big brown one as he said: &ldquo;Rilly gal, I figger
yer ma was right, arter all. &lsquo;Dad,&rsquo; says she, many&rsquo;s
the time, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s hate that brings the sorrow an&rsquo; trouble
to the world an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s love that brings in the happiness.&rsquo;
Like&rsquo;s not my little gal&rsquo;d be livin&rsquo; now if I&rsquo;d
tried seein&rsquo; things <i>her</i> way; if I&rsquo;d welcomed the man
she wanted to marry, &rsquo;stead of hatin&rsquo; him an&rsquo; turnin&rsquo;
him out. He went, when I tol&rsquo; him to, an&rsquo; he took
my gal. I reckon it&rsquo;s that same sort o&rsquo; hate that&rsquo;s
fetched this trouble to my ol&rsquo; messmate, Lem Winslow.
I&rsquo;m done wi&rsquo; it, Rilly gal, done wi&rsquo; hate,
though I figger mos&rsquo; likely it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Muriel felt a hot tear splash on her hand. Pressing
her fresh young cheek against the leathery one,
she implored, &ldquo;Don&rsquo; be talkin&rsquo; that way! How&rsquo;s it
too late, Grand-dad? We&rsquo;ll begin all over, shall we,
yo&rsquo; an&rsquo; me; we&rsquo;ll begin lovin&rsquo; and not hate anyone
at all, shall we, Grand-dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man did not reply, but he held the girl&rsquo;s
hand in a tighter clasp. Then rising and going to
the window, he stood for a moment looking out into
the darkness, waiting until the circling light would
reveal the dory containing the three men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fog is so tarnal thick, they&rsquo;re like to lose
their bearin&rsquo;s an&rsquo; thar&rsquo;d be no savin&rsquo; &rsquo;em if they
got drug into the surf at the pint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after a moment of intense thought, the old
man whirled, his face set with a new determination.
&ldquo;Rilly gal, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to do it,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
oughtn&rsquo;t to, but I&rsquo;ll take the chance.&rdquo; Then, noting
the inquiring expression of the girl&rsquo;s face, the old
man explained: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to hold the big lamp
so &rsquo;twill shine steady toward town till they get into
port. The Outer Ledge&rsquo;ll have to stay dark for a
spell. It&rsquo;s a big chance. I&rsquo;d ought not to take it,
but, by giggers, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII.
<br />THE HEART OF CAP&rsquo;N EZRA.</h2>
<p>Meanwhile the three men in the dory had pushed
away from the small wharf on Windy Island and
had started rowing into the thick, almost impenetrable
blanket of fog, which, having swept in from
the sea, had settled down over the inner harbor.</p>
<p>They could hear the melancholy drawn-out wail
of the foghorn which was beyond the Outer Ledge.
The two longshoremen who were with the doctor
rowed toward the faint glimmer of red light, which
could hardly be distinguished. In fact, there were
times when the lights on the town wharf could not
be seen at all, and once, when the roaring of the
surf seemed nearer than it should be, they realized
with sinking hearts that they had lost their bearings.
Then it was that one of them uttered an exclamation
of astonishment and alarm. &ldquo;The big light!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d ye s&rsquo;pose has happened to it? Look
ye! &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t swingin&rsquo; like it should be. It&rsquo;s hittin&rsquo;
a course straight toward town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Doctor Winslow, at the rudder, turned and looked
over his shoulder at the looming black mass that was
Windy Island. &ldquo;Ezra is doing it to guide us,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;s taking a big chance.&rdquo; Then a sudden
cry of warning: &ldquo;Starboard, hard! We almost
ran head-on into that old buoy that hasn&rsquo;t anchored
a fishing smack since Jerry Mullet&rsquo;s boat went to the
bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big light came jest in the nick o&rsquo; time, I
swan if it didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Lute, in the bow, declared, as
with a powerful stroke, he turned the dory so that
it slipped past the buoy, barely scraping it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Straight ahead now. Give the fleet a wide
berth,&rdquo; the doctor called. The men were pulling
hard when one of them stopped rowing and listened.
&ldquo;Doc Winslow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tarnation take it, if I
didn&rsquo;t hear a ghost right then a-moanin&rsquo; in that old
hulk of Sam Peters&rsquo;. Like&rsquo;s not it&rsquo;s a warning for
us of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being superstitious, the longshoreman was about
to pull away harder than before, when the doctor
commanded: &ldquo;Belay there! Hold your oars!
That&rsquo;s not a ghost. There&rsquo;s someone in that boat.
More than likely it&rsquo;s old Sam himself having one of
his periodical spells. He won&rsquo;t need help if it is, but
I can&rsquo;t pass by without finding out what is wrong.
Thank heaven the light is steady, if all&rsquo;s well on the
outer shoals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>It took but a moment, the fog being illumined,
for the dory to draw up alongside of the boat that
belonged to the frequently intoxicated fisherman
Sam Peters. Not a sound did they hear as they
made fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo;, arter all.&rdquo; Hank Walley
was eager to return to shore. &ldquo;Like as not
&rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Winslow listened intently. He, too, was
anxious to reach the home port, knowing that, not
until then, would his friend Captain Ezra start the
big light swinging on its seaward course; but he
lingered one moment. &ldquo;What ho! Sam there?&rdquo; he
called. But there was no reply. The good doctor
was about to give the command &ldquo;Shove off. Get
under way,&rdquo; when the sharp eyes of the youngest
man, Lute, noted a movement of some dark object
he had supposed was furled sail. Instantly he had
leaped aboard the smack. Holding his lantern high,
he uttered a cry that brought the doctor to his side.
&ldquo;By time!&rdquo; Lute shouted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the boy himself,
but if he ain&rsquo;t dead, he&rsquo;s durn close to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed Gene Beavers, who, after resting a
while on the cask-like buoy, had managed, with almost
superhuman effort, to climb aboard the old
fishing boat. Then he had lost consciousness; in
fact, his breathing was so slight that the words of
the longshoreman seemed about to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The doctor did what he could to revive the lad;
then wrapped him in an old sail cloth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Ten minutes later, Rilla, standing by the side of
Captain Ezra at a window in the tower, uttered a
glad cry. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re swingin&rsquo; &rsquo;em, Grand-dad.
They&rsquo;re swinging the two red lights! They&rsquo;ve found
him. They&rsquo;ve found Gene Beavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God be thanked!&rdquo; the old man said, as he started
the big lamp turning on its usual course. The fog
had lifted out at sea and he scanned the dark waters
anxiously, eagerly. It had been a tremendous chance
that he had taken, and none but his Creator knew
how constantly he had been praying to the One who
rules the sea that all might be well. It was a strange
thing for Captain Ezra to pray, but it seemed easier
since hate had been banished from his heart. Muriel
noticed a new expression in the face of the old man
when, the next morning after breakfast, he said to
her, beaming over his spectacles: &ldquo;Put on yer Sunday
riggin&rsquo;s, Rilly gal. You&rsquo;n me air goin&rsquo; to cruise
over to Tunkett an&rsquo; find out if that city fellar is shipshape
an&rsquo; sailin&rsquo; on even keel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl went around the table, and stooping, she
pressed her warm young cheek against the wrinkled,
leathery forehead.</p>
<p>The old man reached for her hand and held it in
a firm clasp. Neither spoke, but both knew that, at
last, the hatred of many years had left the heart of
Captain Ezra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII.
<br />A SECRET TOLD.</h2>
<p>Doctor Winslow was just leaving the room of
his patient when he heard a familiar voice in the
lower hall. Hurrying down the wide stairway, he
saw standing near the door Cap&rsquo;n Ezra with Muriel
at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the lad comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; the keeper of the light
asked eagerly, when greetings had been exchanged
and the story of the finding of Gene had been told
briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll pull through, I hope and believe,&rdquo; the doctor
replied. &ldquo;He is sleeping now and since he is so
thoroughly exhausted he may sleep for a long time,
but when he has recovered enough to sit up, I&rsquo;ll send
over to the island for you, Rilla, if your grand-dad
will permit you to come. Sometimes pleasant companionship
does more than medicine to help young
people to recuperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to come,&rdquo; Muriel replied almost shyly,
and yet eagerly. Then her hazel eyes were lifted
inquiringly. &ldquo;May I, Grand-dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>It was a hard moment for the old man who had
been hating city folks for many years, but he hesitated
only a second, then he said: &ldquo;Lem, I sort o&rsquo;
feel as all this has been my fault and if yo&rsquo; think
the boy&rsquo;ll get on even keel quicker if fust mate here
is on deck, now and then, yo&rsquo; can count on it, Rilly
gal will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Winslow held out his hand. &ldquo;Thanks,
Ezra,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re more like what you
used to be long ago and I&rsquo;m mighty glad to see it.&rdquo;
Then in an earnest tone, he added: &ldquo;Gene will take
the place to Muriel of the older brother that every
girl in this world ought to have, some one near her
own age to fight her battles, to protect her when the
need arises. That&rsquo;s the sort of a friend Gene will
be to your little girl, Ezra. I&rsquo;ll give you my word
on it, because I know him, as I knew his father before
him. A finer man never lived, and like the
father is the son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Cap&rsquo;n Ezra and Muriel were again on the
main road, the girl said, &ldquo;Grand-dad, bein&rsquo; as we&rsquo;re
in Tunkett, let&rsquo;s go over and s&rsquo;prise Uncle Barney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Rilla had been a very little girl, at Doctor
Winslow&rsquo;s suggestion, she had adopted that good
man as an uncle, but when Captain Barney heard
her prattling &ldquo;Uncle Lem&rdquo; he declared that he wasn&rsquo;t
going to be left out of the family circle as far as she
was concerned, and from that day the kindly old
Irishman had been proud indeed to be called &ldquo;Uncle
Barney&rdquo; by the little maid who was the idol of his
heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>They found the fisherman sitting in the sun in
front of his cabin. He was whittling out a mast for
a toy schooner that he was making for Zoeth
Wixon, a little crippled boy who lived in the shack
about an eighth of a mile farther along on the sand
dunes.</p>
<p>Captain Barney looked up with a welcoming
smile. Indeed his kindly Irish face fairly beamed
when he saw who his visitors were. Rising, he
limped indoors and brought out his one best chair,
a wooden rocker with a gay silk patchwork tidy
upon it.</p>
<p>All of the fisherfolk in the neighborhood had put
together the Christmas before and had purchased
the gift for the old bachelor, who was always doing
some little thing to add to their good cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His house is that empty lookin&rsquo;, with nothin&rsquo; to
set on but boxes and casks,&rdquo; the mother of little
Zoeth had said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s allays whittlin&rsquo; suthin&rsquo; to
help pass the time away for my little Zo, or tellin&rsquo;
him yarns as gives him suthin&rsquo; to think about fo&rsquo;
days. I&rsquo;d like to be gettin&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;n Barney a present
as would make his place look more homelike.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So, too, would I,&rdquo; Mrs. Sam Peters had chimed
in. &ldquo;When my ol&rsquo; man was laid up for two months
las&rsquo; winter, like&rsquo;s not we would have starved if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for the fine cod that Cap&rsquo;n Barney left
at our door every day, an&rsquo; fish bringin&rsquo; a fancy price
then, it bein&rsquo; none too plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When these women told their plan, it was found
that all the families scattered about on the meadows
near the sea had some kindness of Cap&rsquo;n Barney&rsquo;s
to tell about, and when the donated nickles and
dimes and even quarters were counted, the total sum
was sufficient to purchase a rocker in Mis&rsquo; Sol Dexter&rsquo;s
store. True, it had been broken a little, but
Sam Peters, having once been ship carpenter, soon
repaired it until it looked like new.</p>
<p>As for the patchwork tidy, the little crippled boy
himself had been taught by his mother how to make
that. Where to get the pretty silk pieces had indeed
been a problem, for not one of the fishermen&rsquo;s wives
had a bit of silk in her possession. It was then that
Mrs. Sol Dexter did an almost unprecedented thing.
She told how, the year before, her store would have
burned up had it not been that &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Barney,&rdquo;
being there at the time, had leaped right in and had
thrown his slicker over the blaze that had started
near where the gasoline was kept. &ldquo;He knew how
it might explode any minute,&rdquo; she said when recounting
the tale, &ldquo;but he took the chance.&rdquo; While
she talked, Mrs. Sol was actually cutting a piece off
the end of each roll of ribbon that she had in stock,
and then she cut off lace enough to edge the tidy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Captain Barney had been greatly pleased with
the gift, and although he never sat on it himself, he
never ceased admiring the chair and often wished
his old mother in Ireland might have it in her cabin.</p>
<p>The visitors had not been there long, however,
when Captain Ezra said, &ldquo;Rilly gal, why don&rsquo;t yo&rsquo;
cruise around a spell? Yo&rsquo;d sort o&rsquo; like to go over
to Wixon&rsquo;s, wouldn&rsquo;t yo&rsquo; now, and see Lindy and
Zoeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was indeed glad to go, for Lindy Wixon
was near her own age. As soon as she was out of
hearing, Captain Barney looked up from his whittling.
&ldquo;Well, skipper,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
cargo that yo&rsquo;re wantin&rsquo; to unload?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cap&rsquo;n Ezra Bassett puffed on his favorite corncob
pipe for several thoughtful moments before he answered
his friend&rsquo;s question. Then, looking up to
be sure that his &ldquo;gal&rdquo; was not returning, he uncrossed
his legs and leaned forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barney, mate,&rdquo; he solemnly announced, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
writ that letter I tol&rsquo; you I was goin&rsquo; to, some day.
I reckon I&rsquo;ve put in, shipshape, all I know about
Rilly&rsquo;s father, but I don&rsquo; want her to have it till arter
yo&rsquo;ve buried me out at sea. I cal&rsquo;late that&rsquo;ll be time
enough for Rilly to look him up. He&rsquo;s like to take
better care of her, when I&rsquo;m gone, than any one else,
bein&rsquo; as he is her own folks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>Captain Barney bristled. &ldquo;I dunno as to that,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;&rsquo;Pears to me that Lem Winslow or
mesilf ought to be her guardeen if yo&rsquo; go to cruisin&rsquo;
the unknown sea ahead of us. How&rsquo;r we to know
her own pa cares a tarnal whoop for her. He hasn&rsquo;t
been cruisin&rsquo; &rsquo;round these waters huntin&rsquo; her up, has
he? Never&rsquo;s been known to navigate this way, sence&mdash;sence&mdash;&rdquo;
He paused. Something in the face
of his friend caused him to leave his sentence unfinished.
Ezra Bassett arose and looked around both
corners of the shack. All that he saw was a stretch
of rolling white sand with here and there a clump
of coarse, wiry grass or a dwarfed plum bush.</p>
<p>Evidently satisfied that there was no one near
enough to hear, he returned and, drawing his old
armchair nearer the one occupied by Captain Barney,
he said in a low tone: &ldquo;I reckon &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t his fault,
so to speak. I reckon &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then, noting the
surprised expression in the face of his friend, he
continued: &ldquo;Truth is, he doesn&rsquo;t even know there
<i>is</i> a little gal; fact was, he never did know it.&rdquo; Then
he hurried on to explain. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d gone West on business
that couldn&rsquo;t wait, &rsquo;pears like, an&rsquo; my gal reckoned
as how that would be a mighty good time to
come to Windy Island and get me to forgive her and
him. They was livin&rsquo; in New York, but she didn&rsquo;t
get farther&rsquo;n Boston when the little one came. I
got a message to go to her at once. I went, but when
I got there the doctor said as they both had died.
<i>That</i> was the message they&rsquo;d sent on to him, but;
arter all, a miracle happened. The baby showed
signs of life an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, she lived. I tol&rsquo;
the doctor he needn&rsquo;t send another message to the
father. I said as I was the grand-dad, I&rsquo;d tend to
it and take care of the baby till he came.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>While the old man talked, he had been studying
a clump of wire grass in the sand at his feet. Pausing,
he cast a quick glance at his listener, and then,
as quickly looked away and out to sea. For the first
time in the many years of their long friendship
there was an accusing expression in the clear blue
eyes of the Irishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;y think yo&rsquo;ve acted honest, Ez?&rdquo; Captain Barney
inquired. &ldquo;Wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it the same as stealin&rsquo; his
gal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Captain Ezra flared. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t <i>he</i> steal <i>my</i>
gal fust, if it comes to that? Turn about&rsquo;s fair play,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Irishman shook his head. &ldquo;Dunno as
&rsquo;tis, Ez,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I reckon a person&rsquo;s a
heap happier doin&rsquo; the right thing himself, whether
the other fellar does it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Captain Ezra Bassett felt none too comfortable.
&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I wanted to have this
talk with yo&rsquo;. I got to thinkin&rsquo; lately of what would
become of Rilly if I should get a sudden call across
the bar, as the meeting-house hymn puts it, without
havin&rsquo; left any word, or made any provisions; so I
reckoned I&rsquo;d tell yo&rsquo; as how I&rsquo;ve writ that letter. I
put it in the iron box on the shelf way up top o&rsquo; the
tower where I keep the tools for regulatin&rsquo; the
light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Barney nodded. He knew the shelf well,
for he had often helped clean the big lamp or aided
in some needed adjustment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d yo&rsquo; reckon he is now&mdash;Rilla&rsquo;s dad?&rdquo; he
asked after they had puffed awhile in thoughtful
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Never heard sense. I
allays suspicioned as how he might have stayed anchored
out West, but I <i>do</i> know where Rilly gal can
go to find out, if need be, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve put the address in
the letter.&rdquo; Then the old man rose, looking the picture
of rugged health. &ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;m expectin&rsquo; to
start in a hurry on the long v&rsquo;yage for which no
charts have been made,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I sort o&rsquo; got
to thinkin&rsquo; it&rsquo;s well to be beforehanded, an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish the sentence, for a breeze, sweeping
over the dunes, brought to them, not only the
soft, salt tang of the sea, but also the notes of a
girlish song. Both men turned to see a picture which
rejoiced their hearts. Rilla, swinging her Sunday
best hat by its ribbon strings, was skipping toward
them over the hard sand, her long red-brown hair
blowing about her shoulders, her face radiant as she
sang.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Captain Ezra beckoned to her. &ldquo;Yo-ho, Rilly
gal!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mid-morning by the sun and
the big lamp&rsquo;s to have a fine polishin&rsquo; today. I
reckon the storms&rsquo;ll come most any time now and
the light needs to be its brightest then.&rdquo; Turning
to Captain Barney, he said in a low voice: &ldquo;Keep
it dark, mate, &rsquo;bout the letter in the box&mdash;till I&rsquo;m
gone&mdash;then tell her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When his two best friends had departed, Captain
Barney sat long in front of his shack. He wondered
what was to come of it all, but only the future could
reveal that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX.
<br />A FIRST LETTER.</h2>
<p>Muriel had almost forgotten the banded box of
foreign appearance which she had in her Treasure
Cave. So many things of unusual interest had occurred
of late that even so wonderful a box had
taken a secondary place in her thoughts.</p>
<p>That afternoon Captain Ezra devoted to polishing
the lamp, a task he would not permit Rilla to
share, saying that peeling potatoes and the like was
her part of the drudgery, and, as he never helped
her with that, neither should she help with the lamp.</p>
<p>Muriel did not insist, for she believed that her
grand-dad took a great deal of pride in tending to
the big light all by himself. &ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;d think
he was gettin&rsquo; old if he had to be helped,&rdquo; the girl
soliloquized as she walked along the top of the bluff,
the dog at her side.</p>
<p>They descended the trail toward that part of the
beach where she had first seen the lad. For a time
she stood silently gazing down at the spot where
he had been on that never to be forgotten day. Suddenly
she laughed aloud. Stooping, she patted the
head of her long-haired companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shagsie, ol&rsquo; dog,&rdquo; she chuckled gleefully, &ldquo;yo&rsquo;
wouldn&rsquo;t be eatin&rsquo; Gene Beavers up even when I tol&rsquo;
yo&rsquo; to, would yo&rsquo; now?&rdquo; Then merrily she added:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell yo&rsquo; a secret, ol&rsquo; dog, if yo&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be tellin&rsquo;
it.&rdquo; Then she whispered into the long shaggy ear:
&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;m <i>glad</i> now that yo&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then,
springing up, she scrambled down the rocks and ran
along the narrow pebbly beach, the dog racing and
barking at her heels. When they were just below
the lighthouse Rilla paused and looked up at the
small entrance to her cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shags,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s take another look
at the treasure.&rdquo; Together they slowly ascended
the perilously steep cliff where one unused to climbing
could barely have found a foothold.</p>
<p>When the cave was reached Rilla uttered a little
cry of eagerness, for under one of the straps on
the box was a folded bit of paper.</p>
<p>Opening it, she looked at it, her cheeks flushed,
her eyes glowing.</p>
<p>Doctor Winslow had tried to teach the girl to
read, but, since he was the resident physician in a
New York hospital most of the year, he had been
able to make but little headway. Each autumn he
took from one to two months&rsquo; vacation, returning
to the home of his boyhood for what he called an
absolute rest, but the fisherfolk, who loved him,
flocked to him for advice and help, and the kind,
elderly man welcomed them gladly. Too, he gave to
every one who came a bit of optomistic philosophy
which did much toward keeping them well and
happy during the months of his absence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>Muriel had seated herself upon the closed box and
studied the note. Luckily the words were simple
and plainly printed. She picked out one here and
there that she knew, then suddenly rising she went
to a crevice in the rocks and brought forth a Second
Reader which the doctor had given her. She knew
every word in it, but she could not always recognize
the same words if they were out of the book.
After an hour&rsquo;s diligent search, comparing the
printed words with those in the note, she looked up,
her expression joyous, exultant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shagsie, ol&rsquo; dog, I can read it! I can read every
word. It&rsquo;s the fust letter as I ever had, an&rsquo; Gene
Beavers, &rsquo;twas, as left it for me.&rdquo; Then, as the
faithful dog seemed to be interested, the girl slowly
read aloud:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Storm Maiden:&mdash;I am going to try to
reach town tonight. I hope to see you again, but
if I do not I want you to know how much I like you.
I wish girls were all as brave and kind as you are.
Thank you and goodbye.</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;Your friend,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Gene Beavers</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>When the reading was finished the girl sat for a
long time looking out of the small opening at the
gleaming blue waters beyond the cliff and her expression
grew wistful and almost pensive. For the
first time in her fifteen years she was wishing she
had &ldquo;learnin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Suddenly she sprang up, her face
brightening. &ldquo;Shags,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;many&rsquo;s the time
Uncle Lem has said &lsquo;regrettin&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t get you anywhere.
It&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; <i>now</i> that counts.&rsquo;
We&rsquo;ll learn to read, Shags, ol&rsquo; dog! I dunno how,
but we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening as Rilla sat close to her grand-dad
she wanted to ask him if she might attend the Tunkett
school, but he seemed hardly to know that she
was there so occupied was he with his own thoughts,
and so she decided to await a more opportune time.</p>
<p>The truth was that Captain Ezra could not forget
the accusing expression in the Irish blue eyes of his
old mate, nor the question, &ldquo;D&rsquo;y reckon yo&rsquo;re actin&rsquo;
honest, Ez? Hasn&rsquo;t it been the same as stealin&rsquo; his
little gal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, long after Muriel was asleep in her
loft room, Captain Ezra sat at the kitchen table
trying to compose a letter to the father of Rilla, but
each attempt was torn to shreds and many times
the old man stealthily crossed the kitchen floor and
placed the bits in the stove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>At last he thought, &ldquo;I reckon Barney&rsquo;s right, but
thar&rsquo;s no tarnation hurry. I&rsquo;ve signed articles to
tend to this light till I&rsquo;m a long ways older&rsquo;n I am
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So thinking, he went to his bed, meaning soon to
send the letter to Muriel&rsquo;s father, but one thing and
another occupied his time and the letter remained
unwritten.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X.
<br />THE HOPED FOR MESSAGE.</h2>
<p>Each morning when Rilla had finished her task
of &ldquo;swabbing decks,&rdquo; as Captain Ezra called it, and
had put the kitchen and small bedrooms into shipshape
(there were no other rooms in the lean-to adjoining
the light), she would stand in the open door
gazing out across the harbor, waiting, watching for
what she barely confessed to herself. But on the
third day her anxiety concerning her new friend&rsquo;s
condition overcame her timidity at broaching the
subject and after breakfast she ventured: &ldquo;Grand-dad,
will yo&rsquo; be cruisin&rsquo; to town today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head. &ldquo;No, Rilly gal,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t plannin&rsquo; to. Yo&rsquo; don&rsquo; need
&rsquo;nother hair ribbon, do yo&rsquo;, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He had been
filling a lantern as he spoke, but suddenly he paused
and looked up. &ldquo;Sho, now, fust mate, are yo&rsquo; prognosticatin&rsquo;
&rsquo;bout that city chap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arose and looked out across the water, shading
his eyes with his big leathery hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon &rsquo;tis mos&rsquo; time for Lem to be lettin&rsquo; us
know how things are comin&rsquo;. I sartin do hope the
young fellar is navigatin&rsquo; that frail craft of his
into smoother waters. &rsquo;Pears like Doctor Lem ought
to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said no more, for the girl had suddenly
clutched his arm as she cried excitedly: &ldquo;Look yo&rsquo;,
Grand-dad! I&rsquo;m sure sartin there&rsquo;s little Sol puttin&rsquo;
out from the wharf in that Water Rat boat o&rsquo; his.
Now he&rsquo;s dippin&rsquo; along and scuddin&rsquo; right this
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo-o! I reckon he has a message for us. More&rsquo;n
like, Uncle Lem is sendin&rsquo; him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two gazed intently at the small boat, which
did indeed seem to be headed directly for Windy
Island. Rilla, her heart tripping, unconsciously held
tighter to the arm of the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pore little girl,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;was she that lonesome
for young company?&rdquo; He sighed and placed
a big hand over the slender brown one. He felt the
tenseness of the girl&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Grand-dad,&rdquo; she said
tremulously, &ldquo;what if the message is that Gene
Beavers has died. I reckon &rsquo;twould be all my fault.
I&rsquo;d ought to have brought him right up to the house
an&rsquo; tol&rsquo; you straight out just what had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiously they watched the oncoming boat. The
wind, which had been fitful all the morning, dwindled
to the softest breeze, then a calm settled over
the harbor and the sail of the Water Rat flapped
idly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t little Sol row?&rdquo; Muriel exclaimed
impatiently. Then, eagerly, &ldquo;Grand-dad, may I go
out in the dory an&rsquo; meet him? May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use to, Rilly gal. The wind&rsquo;s veered an&rsquo;
thar goes Sol now on a tack. Yo&rsquo; can&rsquo;t be rowin&rsquo;
zigzag all over the harbor.&rdquo; Then, as the boy
seemed to be leisurely sailing away from the island,
the old man stooped and picked up his lantern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho, fust mate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;re &rsquo;way
off our bearin&rsquo;s. Little Sol wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t headin&rsquo; this way,
&rsquo;pears like. Just cruisin&rsquo; about aimless, like he often
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl also decided that this was the truth, and
so she went indoors to procure the week&rsquo;s mending.
When she returned to the armchair outside the lighthouse
she saw that the Water Rat was scudding over
the dancing waves in quite the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Captain Ezra had climbed the tower. Rilla seated
herself and soon her fingers flew as she sewed a
patch upon a blue denim garment, while her thoughts
returned to Gene Beavers. She recalled that he had
looked frail, but she had supposed his paleness was
due to the fact that he lived in the city. Too, she
realized that she had been hoping for days that
Doctor Winslow would send a message telling her
that Gene Beavers was sitting up and that she might
visit him, for, wonder of wonders, her grand-dad
had said that she might go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>Looking up from the garment a few moments
later, her glance again swept over the gleaming
waters of the harbor. The Water Rat was nowhere
to be seen. Alarmed, the girl sprang to her feet and
ran to the top of the steep flight of steps leading
down to the shore. Her anxiety was quickly changed
to joy, for clattering up toward her was the freckle-faced
boy, and a grin of delight spread over his
homely features when he saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rilly, look&rsquo;t that, will yo&rsquo;?&rdquo; he sang out as he
held up a silver dollar. &ldquo;Made it as easy as sailin&rsquo;.
Yo&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t guess how, I bet. Could yo&rsquo; now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head and then listened eagerly,
breathlessly, hoping that in reality she did know.
Nor was she wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the boy confided, &ldquo;that city guy that&rsquo;s up
to Doc Winslow&rsquo;s, he &rsquo;twas guv it to me, if I&rsquo;d
fetch a note over to Windy Island and hand it to
Cap&rsquo;n Ezra and to no one else, says he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rilla&rsquo;s eyes shone like stars. Running to the door
at the foot of the spiral stairs that led up to the light,
she shouted: &ldquo;Grand-dad! Yo-o! Are yo&rsquo; a-comin&rsquo;
down or shall we come up? Little Sol&rsquo;s here an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;s got a message for yo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sho now, is that so? I snum yo&rsquo; was right,
arter all, in yer calcalations, Rilly gal,&rdquo; the beaming
old man said as he descended the circling flight of
stairs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the message that Lem sent? Is
the city fellar&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dunno,&rdquo; Muriel interrupted. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Gene
Beavers himself as sent the note and he said as it
was to be given to no one but just yo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old sea captain was pleased. The boy was
square and aboveboard, that was evident. &ldquo;Wall,&rdquo;
he said as he reached the ground, &ldquo;little Sol, hist up
the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small boy thrust his hand in one of his
pockets, but drew it empty. &ldquo;Jumpin&rsquo; frogs!&rdquo; he
ejaculated. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t go an&rsquo; change my jacket
arter the city guy give me that letter. I reckon as
how I&rsquo;ll have to go back arter it.&rdquo; But suddenly
his expression changed and he beamed up at them.
&ldquo;By time, I rec&rsquo;lect now! I stowed it in here for
safe keepin&rsquo;.&rdquo; As he spoke he removed his cap and
took the note from the ragged lining. He handed
the envelope to the captain and then started running
toward the steps leading to the beach, but the old
man recalled him. &ldquo;Ho, thar, little Sol, lay to a
spell. I reckon there may be an answer to go ashore
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy returned slowly and the girl eagerly
watched the captain as he read the message which
the note contained. Muriel knew by the expression
in her grandfather&rsquo;s face that the old-time struggle
was going on in his heart, but it didn&rsquo;t last long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is Gene Beavers a-sittin&rsquo; up?&rdquo; the girl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears like he is,&rdquo; Captain Ezra said as he folded
the note and placed it in his pocket. &ldquo;Lem&rsquo;s writ
for you to cruise over to town with little Sol and
stay a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s face shone, but, after glancing at the sun,
she inquired: &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t I better wait till arter
mid-day? Who&rsquo;ll be fryin&rsquo; the fish and pertaters
for yo&rsquo;, Grand-dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s heart rejoiced, for his &ldquo;gal&rdquo; was
really thinking of him first, after all, but his hearty
laughter pealed out as he replied: &ldquo;When yo&rsquo; was
a little un who&rsquo;d yo&rsquo; s&rsquo;pose fried cod for the two of
us if &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t me? I was steward o&rsquo; the lighthouse
craft long afore yo&rsquo; signed articles to sail along as
fust mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsively the girl threw her arms about the
neck of the old man and kissed his leathery cheek.
She took this opportunity to whisper into his ear:
&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;re that good to me, Grand-dad! I&rsquo;ll never be
leavin&rsquo; you, never, never, never!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Instinctively the girl knew what was in the thought
of the old man. Little Sol was eager to return to
the mainland that he might display to his mother the
first silver dollar that he had ever earned and so the
happy girl climbed to the little room over the kitchen
and put on what her grand-dad called her &ldquo;Sunday
riggin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; She hesitated just a moment between the
red hair ribbon and the green, then choosing the latter,
she peered into the broken bit of mirror to tie it
as best she could on her red-brown hair. Then seizing
her flower-wreathed hat by its strings, down
the stairs she skipped. Shags, sensing the holiday
spirit that was in the air, barked joyfully when she
appeared and was quite crestfallen when he was told
that he must stay and help grand-dad guard the
light.</p>
<p>The old man stood at the top of the steps and
swung his cap when Muriel, sitting in the stern of
the Water Rat, turned at the first buoy and waved
to him.</p>
<p>In the heart of Captain Ezra, for the second time
in many years, there was a prayer that the One at
the helm might guide his &ldquo;gal&rdquo; aright.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI.
<br />A PARTY FOR TWO.</h2>
<p>Brazilla Mullet, the elderly spinster sister of
Jabez Mullet, who drove the stage, had been the
doctor&rsquo;s housekeeper for many years. She and her
brother occupied the neat little cottage just beyond
the hedge, and Jabez, when he was not driving, was
gardener for both places.</p>
<p>Half an hour after Gene Beavers had sent the note
to Windy Island by little sol from the glassed-in
end of Doctor Winslow&rsquo;s veranda he had been
eagerly watching the road.</p>
<p>Miss Brazilla busied herself in the rooms adjoining
that she might hear the boy&rsquo;s slightest movement.
Doctor Winslow had cautioned her that
Gene, who was restless because of his prolonged inactivity,
must not be permitted to leave the couch,
where he was comfortably propped to a position that
was half reclining by many pillows.</p>
<p>The doctor himself, after having written the note
to Captain Ezra, had been suddenly called on an
emergency case out at the Life Saving Station on
The Point, and that was why Gene had been the one
to give instructions concerning the delivery of the
message.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it now, Miss Brazilla?&rdquo; the boy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nigh to eleven, Master Gene,&rdquo; the housekeeper
appeared in the doorway to remark, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
hopin&rsquo; the pore gal will get here in time for a bite
with yo&rsquo;. In all the years I&rsquo;ve heerd tell about that
child she&rsquo;s never tuk a meal off Windy Island. &rsquo;Twill
be a reg&rsquo;lar party for Rilla, that it will&mdash;if she&rsquo;s let
to come. I don&rsquo;t want to be disappointin&rsquo;, Master
Gene, yo&rsquo; and doctor settin&rsquo; so much store on her
comin&rsquo;, but I know Cap&rsquo;n Ezra purty well and a man
more sot in his opinion don&rsquo;t live&mdash;not in Tunkett
anyhow, an&rsquo; many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve heerd him say that
his gal should never ever set eyes on city folks, if <i>he</i>
could be helpin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the elderly spinster, Miss Brazilla, might be said
to have a failing it was loquacity, and Gene moved
restlessly.</p>
<p>Instantly she was at his side. &ldquo;There now,
dearie,&rdquo; the really kind-hearted woman exclaimed
self-rebukingly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d ought to&rsquo;ve pushed that couch
farther to the starboard side o&rsquo; this deck.&rdquo; Then
she laughed apologetically. &ldquo;That salt water language
will crop out now&rsquo;n then, try as I may to talk
fine, like city folks. There! Is that better? The
sun don&rsquo;t shine right into your eyes now like it did.
Wall, as I was sayin&rsquo;, if Rilly can come in time to
eat with yo&rsquo;, &rsquo;twill be a reg&rsquo;lar party for her an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Poor Gene, realizing that Miss Brazilla was
launched again upon another flood of conversation,
tried to think of a way to politely interrupt, if an
interruption ever can be polite. The word &ldquo;party&rdquo;
caught his attention. Many a time he had heard his
sister Helen say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never a real party unless
there&rsquo;s ice cream.&rdquo; Maybe all girls felt that way.</p>
<p>The housekeeper was actually turning to leave,
having reached a period, and Gene made haste to
inquire: &ldquo;Miss Brazilla, is there any place in Tunkett
where we could get some ice cream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amazed spinster shook her head, on which the
rather sparse red-grey hairs were drawn back and
down with oily smoothness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Master Gene, not arter the summer
colony folks go. When the hot weather&rsquo;s on, Mrs.
Sol makes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone her, please, Miss Brazilla, and ask her
if she couldn&rsquo;t make some right away now and put
strawberries in it. Tell her that she may name her
own price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mullet lifted her hands in amazement.
&ldquo;Land o&rsquo; Goshen!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;Ice cream with
strawberries in October.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Then noting that the lad had dropped back among
the pillows and closed his eyes as though he were
suddenly very weary, the good woman slipped away
to do his bidding, strange as it might seem. &ldquo;Sick
folks take notions,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;but this is
the tarnal queerest I ever heerd of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later there was a timid rap on the
side door. Miss Brazilla hurried to open it, and, as
she had hoped, there stood Muriel Storm.</p>
<p>Gene had fallen into a light slumber, which had
greatly refreshed him, and when he awakened he
heard Muriel&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Top o&rsquo; the morning to you,
Storm Maiden,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Do hurry! I&rsquo;m eager
to see if you look as I remember you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she did not, for the Muriel with her long red-brown
hair neatly tied back with a wide green ribbon,
which Miss Brazilla had made for her into a
truly beautiful butterfly bow, did not look quite like
his memoried picture of that stormy girl who with
long hair wind-blown about her shoulders, had ordered
him to leave the Lighthouse Island or be devoured
by her dog.</p>
<p>Almost shyly the girl, in her neat green gingham
dress, paused in the open doorway, hardly knowing
what to do. Gene held out a frail white hand.
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come and shake hands with me?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry that I can&rsquo;t come to you, but I
have had orders to lie here until mine host decrees
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>The girl, touched by the boy&rsquo;s paleness, forgot her
embarrassment and went toward him, placing her
strong brown hand in the one he had stretched
forth to greet her. Then, seating herself in the
wicker chair nearest, she said: &ldquo;I hope yo&rsquo;re forgivin&rsquo;
me, Mr. Beavers, for makin&rsquo; it so that yo&rsquo; had
to swim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I who used poor judgment,&rdquo; the boy told
her. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t feel that you were in the least bit to
blame.&rdquo; Then, smiling up at her in his friendliest
fashion, he added: &ldquo;We are only in our teens, you
and I, and that&rsquo;s not so very grown up. Don&rsquo;t you
think you could call me Gene and permit me to call
you Muriel? It&rsquo;s a beautiful name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas my mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The boy thought he had
never heard that word spoken with greater tenderness.
Shyly, the girl was saying: &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be
that pleased if yo&rsquo; would call me the whole of it
Thar&rsquo;s no one as calls me Muriel. Folks here jest
call me Rilly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will gladly. Now, Muriel,&rdquo; the lad
leaned on his elbow, &ldquo;the best way for two people
to become acquainted is by asking questions. Won&rsquo;t
you tell me how you pass your time, what books you
read, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Gene paused, almost startled by the sudden flush
that had crimsoned the cheeks of his guest. When
it was too late he tried to prevent her from having
to make the admission, but falteringly she made it.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t read books,&rdquo; she said. Then the resolve
of the day before gave her new courage, and lifting
her head and looking directly into his eyes with an
eager expression, she added: &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
learn. I don&rsquo; know how, but I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you are, Muriel,&rdquo; was his hearty response.
&ldquo;And if I am laid up long in &lsquo;dry dock for
repairs,&rsquo; as Mr. Jabez Mullet calls my confinement,
perhaps you will let me help you. <i>I</i> had to be helped,
you know. We all do, just in the beginning.&rdquo; The
lad&rsquo;s smile was winsome. Then he quickly added:
&ldquo;There are the noon bells from the church tower,
and if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, Miss Brazilla is coming to
serve our lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel sprang up when the housekeeper appeared.
&ldquo;Why, Miss Brazilla, me settin&rsquo; here and lettin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;
wait on me! Mayn&rsquo;t I help somehow? I&rsquo;m real
handy at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are, Rilly. Fetch that little wicker table
over here and stand it near the couch. Then draw
your chair and set opposite. Yo&rsquo;re company today,
just like a grand young lady, and yo&rsquo;ve nothin&rsquo; to
do but eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel went to the far end of the veranda to get
the small wicker table, and when she turned she was
amazed to see Miss Brazilla and Gene exchanging
nods and smiles. What could it mean, the girl
wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>The lunch was daintily served and Gene became
so interested in his companion&rsquo;s tales of storms and
wrecks at sea, simply yet dramatically told, that he
ate far more heartily than he would have done alone.
Miss Brazilla made no comment, but she was secretly
pleased.</p>
<p>Having cleared the table, she surprised Muriel by
bringing in two dishes heaped with ice cream in
which were preserved strawberries.</p>
<p>Gene Beavers was to pay a fabulous price for that
out-of-season dessert, but when he saw the glad light
dawning in the hazel eyes of his guest he decided it
was well worth it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only had ice cream once before,&rdquo; she confessed,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; that was when Mis&rsquo; Sol had some left over that
was like to melt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After lunch Muriel told her host that he ought to
sleep a while, and, when she assured him that she
could stay all afternoon, the truly weary lad consented
to rest, while Rilla helped Miss Brazilla in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>An hour later when the lad awakened, refreshed,
he saw that Muriel was again in the comfortable
wicker chair at his side, looking with great interest
at the beautifully colored pictures in a large book
that she held.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>She glanced up glowingly when she heard a movement
on the couch. &ldquo;The readin&rsquo; in it is about the
sea, I reckon, from the pictures of boats and pirates,&rdquo;
she told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; Gene exclaimed with enthusiasm.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Treasure Island. If you&rsquo;ll prop me up more
I&rsquo;ll read to you, if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time later, when Dr. Winslow returned,
he found Gene reading aloud from his favorite book,
while Muriel, leaning forward, listened hungrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, little Nurse Rilla,&rdquo; the good man exclaimed,
&ldquo;our patient is much better, I can see that at a
glance. I&rsquo;m sorry to hurry you away, but your
boatswain Sol is waiting for you down at the gate.
Your grand-dad told him to sail you back to Windy
Island along about this time, but you&rsquo;re to come
again and often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Captain Ezra pushed his armchair
back from the table, and while he was lighting his
pipe he looked at his &ldquo;gal,&rdquo; his eyes twinkling.
&ldquo;Rilly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yo&rsquo;ve been gabblin&rsquo; faster&rsquo;n chain
lightnin&rsquo; one hour by the clock, an&rsquo; things are sort
o&rsquo; muddled in my mind. I dunno, for sure sartin,
whether it&rsquo;s Billy Bones or Gene Beavers yo&rsquo;ve been
over to the mainland a visitin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of &rsquo;em, thanks to yo&rsquo;, dear ol&rsquo; Grand-dad,&rdquo;
Muriel said. Then, kissing him good-night, she
went up to her little loft room. But when she was
snugly in her bed it was not of Billy Bones that she
dreamed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII.
<br />WEE IRISHY CAKES.</h2>
<p>Muriel awakened the next morning with a song
in her heart that she was soon expressing in clear,
sweet notes which told the listener how glad, glad
the singer was just to be alive.</p>
<p>Captain Ezra, busying himself near the open
kitchen door, sighed softly as he realized that this
wordless song was different from the others that
Muriel had sung in the mornings that were past as
she prepared their simple breakfast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>There had been words to those other songs, sometimes
hymns that the lassie had memorized from
having often heard them repeated at the meeting-house,
whither she had been permitted to go when the
summer colony was closed. Then again, there had
been times when she had set words of her own to the
meeting-house tunes; lilting melodies they were of
winging gulls and of the mermaids who lived in the
sea. But this morning there was a new and eager joyousness
in the girl&rsquo;s singing. For the first time in her
fifteen years, the gates of her prison had been flung
wide and she had stepped out into a strange world,
timidly, perhaps, but soon forgetting herself in her
delight at what she had found, a world of books, of
young companionship, of adventure and romance.
Muriel, even if she were again imprisoned, would
never be quite the same. But the newly awakened
love in the heart of Captain Ezra had been the key
that had opened the door for his &ldquo;gal,&rdquo; and she was
now free to come and go as she wished, because he
trusted her. She would not leave him without telling
him nor would he detain her if she wished to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Top o&rsquo; the mornin&rsquo; to you, Grand-dad,&rdquo; she
called, when the fish were done to a turn and the
potatoes were crispy brown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a mind to be
bakin&rsquo; today,&rdquo; she continued when he was seated
at the table. &ldquo;Some o&rsquo; those wee Irishy cakes that
Uncle Barney taught me how to make, just like his
&lsquo;auld&rsquo; mother did. He&rsquo;s allays askin&rsquo; for &rsquo;em when
he docks at Windy Island. He&rsquo;s been laid up so long,
I cal&rsquo;late the taste of &rsquo;em might be cheerin&rsquo; him,
wouldn&rsquo;t you reckon they might, Grand-dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young arms were about the old man&rsquo;s neck
and her fresh young cheek rested against the forehead
that was leathered by exposure to the sun and
wind and beating rain.</p>
<p>There was a twinkle in the grey eye that was nearest
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cal-late as &rsquo;twould add to ol&rsquo; Cap&rsquo;n Barney&rsquo;s
cheer if the stewardess herself toted them cookies
to his stranded ol&rsquo; craft on the dunes. Was that
what yo&rsquo; was figgerin&rsquo; on doin&rsquo;, fust mate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If yo&rsquo;d like to take me, Grand-dad.&rdquo; This very
demurely. The old sea captain put down his knife
and fork and laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon a gal who knows how to sail a boat
better&rsquo;n most folks don&rsquo; need a boatman to cruise
her over to the mainland. Sho now, Rilly! Navigate
yer own craft. The embargo&rsquo;s lifted, as the
newspapers put it. Come and go when it&rsquo;s to yer
likin&rsquo;. Jest be lettin&rsquo; me know.&rdquo; Then he added, as
though it were an after-thought: &ldquo;When yo&rsquo; carry
yer cargo o&rsquo; cakes to town, if I was yo&rsquo; I&rsquo;d leave a
few at Miss Brazilla&rsquo;s cottage. I reckon yer new
friend might be likin&rsquo; the taste o&rsquo; suthin&rsquo; differ&rsquo;nt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s cheeks were rosy. &ldquo;Grand-dad,&rdquo; she
protested, &ldquo;I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t thinkin&rsquo; of Gene Beavers, honest
I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t! I just reckoned &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t fair for me to be
spendin&rsquo; a whole arternoon wi&rsquo; a <i>new</i> friend when
an ol&rsquo; one who&rsquo;s been lovin&rsquo; me for years back is
laid up in drydock an&rsquo; needs me even more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hazel eyes looked across the table so frankly
that the teasing twinkle faded in the grey eyes and
an expression of infinite tenderness took its place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I understand, fust mate,&rdquo; the old man
said. &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Barney&rsquo;s got a heart in him as big as
the hold in a freight boat, but thar&rsquo;s a powerful lot
of loneliness in it, for all that he&rsquo;s allays doin&rsquo;
neighborly things for the folks on the dunes. Barney&rsquo;s
been hankerin&rsquo; for years to be goin&rsquo; back to
his ol&rsquo; mother, but she keeps writin&rsquo; him to be stayin&rsquo;
in America, and that she&rsquo;ll come to keep his house as
soon as her duty&rsquo;s done, but she don&rsquo; come, for it&rsquo;s
this un&rsquo; and that un&rsquo; over thar that&rsquo;s in need of her
ministrin&rsquo;. Some day, I reckon, Barney&rsquo;ll pull up
anchor and set sail for his Emerald Isle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grand-dad,&rdquo; Rilla said, with sudden tears in
her eyes, &ldquo;you&rsquo;n me&rsquo;ll be that lonely if he goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the morning, while Muriel busied herself
with making the little &ldquo;Irishy&rdquo; cakes, she did not
sing, nor was she thinking of Gene Beavers, for all
of her thoughts were of her dear friend, old Captain
Barney. Somehow she hadn&rsquo;t realized before how
lonesome he must be so far away from kith and kin.
The fisherfolk living about him on the dunes were
not from his country, nor were their interests his
interests. They loved him, but could not understand
him, for, as Mrs. Sam Peters had said one
day to a group of the wives: &ldquo;How can a body
understand a man with grey hair on the top o&rsquo; his
head who believes in the fairies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel understood him, and so no wonder was
it that they two were the closest of friends.</p>
<p>Long rows of pert looking little cakes with spiral
peaks were on the white pine shelf when Cap&rsquo;n Ezra
heard the welcome call for mess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yo, Rilly gal,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;looks like a baker
shop for sure sartin. How much a dozen are yo&rsquo;
askin&rsquo; for yer wares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;re to have a dozen for the takin&rsquo;, Grand-dad,&rdquo;
the girl, flushed from the heat of the stove,
told him beamingly. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo;re share o&rsquo; &rsquo;em is on the
table waitin&rsquo; yer comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they be,&rdquo; the old man declared as he caught
sight of the plate heaped with little cakes near his
place. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t be leavin&rsquo; yer ol&rsquo; Grand-dad
out, would yo&rsquo;, fust mate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave yo&rsquo; out, Grand-dad?&rdquo; The questioner
seemed amazed that such a suggestion could be
made. &ldquo;Why, if all the folks in all the world were
to go somewhar&rsquo;s else an&rsquo; I still had you, I&rsquo;d be that
happy an&rsquo; content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl said this nestled close in the old man&rsquo;s
arms, and over her head he wiped away a tear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thunderation fish-hooks!&rdquo; he exclaimed gruffly.
&ldquo;What a tarnal lot o&rsquo; sentiment, sort of, we two
folks do think lately. I reckon your grand-dad&rsquo;s
cruisin&rsquo; into his second childhood faster&rsquo;n a full
rigged schooner can sail ahead of a gale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughingly Muriel skipped to the stove and carried
the black iron spider to the table to serve Captain
Ezra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;s better off we are when we are childlike,
Grand-dad,&rdquo; she said. Then with sweet seriousness
she added: &ldquo;You know the Good Book
tells that it&rsquo;s only them that becomes like a child
again that can enter the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;
Taking her place opposite the old man, the girl sat
for a moment looking out of the open window at
the shining waters of the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it means that we must be trustin&rsquo; like
a little child is, knowin&rsquo; our Father in Heaven <i>wants</i>
to take care of us. I reckon we&rsquo;d ought to be like
little Zoeth was the day that Mr. Wixon got mad
an&rsquo; was goin&rsquo; to cruise off and leave his fam&rsquo;ly forever.
He was packin&rsquo; up his kit, sayin&rsquo; hard words
all the time, when little cripple Zoeth clumped over
to him, and slippin&rsquo; that frail hand o&rsquo; his into the
big one, he said, trustin&rsquo; like: &lsquo;Ma says yer goin&rsquo;
away forever, but I <i>know</i> &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t so. Yo&rsquo;re <i>my</i> dad
and yer wantin&rsquo; to take care o&rsquo; me, aren&rsquo;t yo&rsquo;, Dad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; recollect that Mr. Wixon stayed, and,
what&rsquo;s more, Mis&rsquo; Wixon, she changed, too.
She stopped peckin&rsquo; about suthin&rsquo; all the time
an&rsquo; tried to figure out what she could do to make her
home happy, an&rsquo; she <i>did</i> it, Grand-dad. I reckon that
little ol&rsquo; shack o&rsquo; the Wixons is the happiest home
on the dunes.&rdquo; Then, taking up her knife and fork,
she added: &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late that&rsquo;s what the Good Book
means, just trustin&rsquo; an&rsquo; bein&rsquo; happy-hearted like a
child.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>An hour later Captain Ezra stood at the top of the
steep steps leading down the cliff and watched while
his &ldquo;gal&rdquo; rowed the dory over toward the mainland.</p>
<p>The girl looked up at the first buoy and waved
to the one she loved most in all the world.</p>
<p>Little Sol was down on the wharf, and with him
were several small boys and girls, rather unkempt,
rough mannered little creatures, for the wives of
the fishermen hadn&rsquo;t much money to spend and the
children were permitted to grow up as untutored as
water rats. When Rilla landed they ran to her
with arms outstretched. &ldquo;Rilly, Rilly,&rdquo; they clamored,
&ldquo;be tellin&rsquo; us a story &rsquo;bout the mermaid that
lived in a cave an&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; how the tail on her changed to two legs an&rsquo;
she was married to a prince,&rdquo; the oldest among
them concluded. Many a time Muriel had told them
this story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I haven&rsquo;t time today,&rdquo; Rilla said with
a quick glance at the sun. Then suddenly she
thought of something. In her basket there were
two packages. In the larger one there were cakes
for Uncle Barney. That could not be touched. But
in the smaller one there were cakes which she had
planned leaving at the Mullet cottage for Gene.
After all, it was hardly fair when he had all the
goodies he wished and these raggedy children almost
never had anything but fish and potatoes. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late
I have time to be givin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; each a little cake,&rdquo;
Muriel announced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Placing her basket on a roll of tarred rope, she
opened the smaller package and passed around the
crispy little cakes and when she saw the glow in the
eyes that looked up at her she was glad of her decision.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll be learnin&rsquo; the manners,&rdquo; she
laughingly told the children, who gazed at her with
wide-eyed wonder. &ldquo;Each of yo&rsquo; be makin&rsquo; a bow
and say, &lsquo;Thank you, Rilly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fine lady had come to Windy Island the summer
before to visit the light and with her had been a
fairy-like girl of seven. Muriel had been baking
cakes that day and had given her one. To her surprise,
the child had made the prettiest curtsy and had
said, &ldquo;Thank you, Miss Muriel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever strange thing Rilla might ask the children
to do they would at least attempt it, and so,
holding fast with grimy fingers to the precious
cakes, they watched the older girl as she showed
them how to curtsy. Then they tried to do likewise,
the while they piped out, &ldquo;Thank yo&rsquo;, Rilly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, dearies, allays do that arter yo&rsquo;ve been
given anythin&rsquo; nice,&rdquo; she bade them. &ldquo;Ye-ah, Rilly,
we-uns will,&rdquo; was the reply that followed her.
But it was rather muffled, for the cakes were being
hungrily devoured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Muriel wished that she could give each child another,
but she could not open Uncle Barney&rsquo;s package,
and so, turning to wave goodbye, she left the
wharf and set out across the dunes in the direction
of the Irishman&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII.
<br />NEIGHBORLINESS.</h2>
<p>As Muriel neared the shanty on the sand dunes
in which lived her dearly beloved friend, Captain
Barney, she was conscious of unusual noises issuing
therefrom. Surely there was some kind of a commotion
going on within the humble dwelling. Separating
the sounds as she approached, she recognized
one as laughter (none but Linda Wixon
laughed like that), then there was the clumping of
little Zoeth&rsquo;s crutches, and his shrill, excited chatter.
This was followed by a hammering and a
chorus of approving feminine voices.</p>
<p>Muriel hastened her steps. It was impossible to
run in the soft sand. &ldquo;What can be goin&rsquo; on in
Uncle Barney&rsquo;s shack?&rdquo; she wondered. &ldquo;I reckon
he&rsquo;s givin&rsquo; a party, though I cal&rsquo;late that isn&rsquo;t likely,
he bein&rsquo; laid up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her thoughts were interrupted
by the genial Irishman himself, who appeared
around the corner of the shanty carrying an
old rusty stovepipe which he had replaced with a
new one. Rilla noticed that he was stepping as
spryly as ever he had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Top o&rsquo; the mornin&rsquo; to you, mavourneen,&rdquo; he
called. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great news I&rsquo;m after havin&rsquo;. Me ol&rsquo;
mither as I&rsquo;ve been hungerin&rsquo; for a sight of these tin
year past is comin&rsquo; at last to live here on the dunes,
and the heart o&rsquo; me is singin&rsquo; a melody like &lsquo;The
harp that once through Tara&rsquo;s halls the soul of
music shed&rsquo;; but &rsquo;twas Tommy Moore said it that
way, not your ol&rsquo; Uncle Barney. That&rsquo;s what poets
are for, I reckon, to be puttin&rsquo; into words for us the
joy we can only be feelin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Then, as they reached
the open front door of the shack, Captain Barney
called: &ldquo;Belay there, folks, and be makin&rsquo; yer best
bows to our neighbor from across the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo-o, Rilly! It&rsquo;s yo&rsquo; that&rsquo;s come just in time to
be tellin&rsquo; what yo&rsquo; reckon&rsquo;s the best place to be hangin&rsquo;
the pictures.&rdquo; It was fifteen-year-old Lindy
Wixon who skipped forward and caught her friend
by the hand as she went on to explain: &ldquo;I got &rsquo;em
wi&rsquo; soap wrappers. I went all over Tunkett collectin&rsquo;.
Every-un was glad, an&rsquo; more, to give &rsquo;em when
they heard as Cap&rsquo;n Barney&rsquo;s ol&rsquo; mither is comin&rsquo; at
last. We want to purty up the shack so &rsquo;twill look
homey an&rsquo; smilin&rsquo; a welcome to her the minute she
steps into the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-h, but they&rsquo;re handsome!&rdquo; Muriel said, clasping
her hands. Zoeth was standing near looking
eagerly up into the face of his beloved friend.
&ldquo;Which of &rsquo;em do you reckon is purtiest?&rdquo; he queried;
then waited her reply as though it were a
matter of great importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Muriel gazed long at the three brightly colored
prints which had been hung on three sides of the
room. &ldquo;I dunno, honest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all
that beautiful, but I sort o&rsquo; like the one wi&rsquo; the lighthouse
in it best. The surf crashes over those rocks
real natural, now don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zoeth clapped his thin little hands. &ldquo;That thar&rsquo;s
the one I chose, too, Rilly. I knew yo&rsquo;d choose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam Peters, who had at one time been a ship
carpenter, was busily hammering at one side of the
room where a long low window looked out toward
the sea. &ldquo;That thar&rsquo;s a windy-seat my Sam is makin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
his wife explained to Muriel. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve one up
to Judge Lander&rsquo;s where I go Mondays to wash,
and when I was tellin&rsquo; Mis&rsquo; Lander how we was
plannin&rsquo; to purty up Cap&rsquo;n Barney&rsquo;s shack, bein&rsquo; as
his ol&rsquo; mither&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;, she said if we had a couch
or a windy-seat she&rsquo;d be glad to donate some pillas
as she had in the attic, an&rsquo; when she fetched &rsquo;em
down, if thar wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a beautiful turkey-red couch
cover amongst &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window-seat was fast nearing completion
and so the group turned admiring eyes from the pictures
to the handiwork of Sam Peters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Make way, thar!&rdquo; his wife was heard to exclaim
a moment later from the rear. Everyone turned to
see that portly woman approaching, a somewhat
faded turkey-red lounge cover dragging one fringed
corner, while four pillows of as many different colors
were in her arms.</p>
<p>Lindy and Muriel sprang forward to assist her,
but Mrs. Sam would permit them to do nothing but
hold the pillows, while she herself placed them at
what she believed to be fashionable angles.</p>
<p>Then with arms akimbo, she stood back and admired
the result.</p>
<p>She was sure that Mrs. Judge Lander herself could
not have arranged the pillows with more artistic
effect. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d ought to <i>all</i> of us fix our cabins up
that fine,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That red&rsquo;s powerful han&rsquo;some,&rdquo; Mrs. Jubal Smalley
remarked. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;d ought to be a plant settin&rsquo;
on the window sill, just atop o&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one noticed when little Zoeth slipped away,
but they all saw him return triumphantly bearing his
greatest treasure, a potted geranium which had three
scarlet blossoms. With cheeks burning and eyes
glowing, the little fellow placed it upon the window
sill. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for yer mither to keep,&rdquo; he said, looking
up at the Irishman, who was deeply touched, for well
he knew how the little fellow had nursed the plant,
which the year before Lindy had rescued from a
rubbish heap in the summer colony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Out of his savings Captain Barney had purchased
from Mrs. Sol a table and four straight chairs.</p>
<p>When everything was shipshape and Sam Peters
was packing away his tools, Captain Barney spoke.
&ldquo;Neighbors,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;in the name of me ol&rsquo;
mither I want to be thankin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a hard life
she&rsquo;s been havin&rsquo; in the ol&rsquo; country, what wi&rsquo; raisin&rsquo;
tin of her own an&rsquo; two that she tuk as were left
orphants. Says she, when no one else wanted &rsquo;em,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em, the poor darlints. If thar&rsquo;s allays
room for one more, the saints helpin&rsquo;, we&rsquo;ll stretch
that room so &rsquo;twill hold the two of &rsquo;em.&rsquo; An&rsquo; now
that the last of &rsquo;em is growd, it&rsquo;s aisy I want her to
be takin&rsquo; it. She can be drawin&rsquo; the rocker as yo&rsquo;
all gave me up to the open door an&rsquo; she kin jest be
settin&rsquo; an&rsquo; rockin&rsquo; an&rsquo; restin&rsquo; an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; out at the
sea. &rsquo;Twill be nigh like Heaven for me ol&rsquo; mither,
an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s thankin&rsquo; ye again I am for all ye&rsquo;ve been
doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somebody tried to say something, but it ended in
a sincere handshaking, and many eyes were moist.
Then Muriel and her dear friend were left alone.
With an arm about the girl he loved, the old man
stood looking out at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rilly gal,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;how kind folks are in
this world. It&rsquo;s a pleasant place to be livin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Captain Barney did not realize that the fisher folk
about him were but returning a bit of the loving
kindness which he had shown to them in their many
hours of need.</p>
<p>Glancing at the clock, he said briskly: &ldquo;Nigh
two, Rilly gal. Yer Uncle Barney must be gettin&rsquo;
ready for the three-forty train up to Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>That evening, when Muriel was telling her grandfather
all that had happened, she said: &ldquo;Grand-dad,
I dunno why &rsquo;tis, but I feel sorto&rsquo; as though
things are comin&rsquo; out different from the way Uncle
Barney&rsquo;s plannin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s along of the fact that he&rsquo;s had his
heart sot so many times on his old mither&rsquo;s cruisin&rsquo;
over the big pond, but suthin&rsquo; allays kept her anchored,
seemed like, on &rsquo;tother side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as the old man rose, he looked out toward
the darkening east. &ldquo;Storm&rsquo;s a-breedin&rsquo; at last,
Rilly gal. I swan I never knew an equinoxial to
hold off so long. I reckon &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t git here till
&rsquo;round about mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Then he added: &ldquo;I dunno
why &rsquo;tis, Rilly gal, but I&rsquo;m sort o&rsquo; dreadin&rsquo; the big
storm this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shuddered. A cold night wind was rising.
&ldquo;Grand-dad,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go in an&rsquo; be
readin&rsquo; in the Good Book.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Every night since the one on which he had cast
hate out of his heart the old man had tried to read
from the New Testament to Muriel, and though he
stumbled over many of the longer words, the girl
caught the spirit of it and retold it with her own
interpretation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV.
<br />THE STORM.</h2>
<p>The expected storm arrived the next day, although
not in its usual fury. However, as there was
no real need for Muriel or her grandfather to cross
the bay, which was wind-lashed into white-capped,
choppy waves, they remained in the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer the way our reg&rsquo;lar crasher of a storm is
delayin&rsquo; this year,&rdquo; Captain Ezra said on the third
night after the rains began. Muriel, who was washing
cups at the time, suddenly whirled, and throwing
her arms about the old man, regardless of her
soapy hands, she cried passionately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad if they never came, Grand-dad. I
don&rsquo;t know why &rsquo;tis, but when the lightning zigzags
all aroun&rsquo; like a sword of fire, the thunder seems to
roar, &lsquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll crash yer light that&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo; to
defy me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>The old captain looked truly distressed. &ldquo;Rilly
gal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish yo&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t take such queer notions.
You&rsquo;re jest like yer mother was before yo&rsquo;.
She used to come singing down from the top o&rsquo; the
cliff and tell me yarns &rsquo;bout what the wind and the
waves had been tellin&rsquo; her. Lem used to say she&rsquo;d
ought to be sent somewhar&rsquo;s an&rsquo; taught to write
stories. That&rsquo;d be a good channel, he opinioned, to
let out the notions that was cooped up in her head,
an&rsquo; here yo&rsquo; are jest like her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked so truly distressed that the
girl exclaimed contritely: &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; dear ol&rsquo; Grand-dad,
if it&rsquo;s worryin&rsquo; yo&rsquo;, I&rsquo;ll try to be diff&rsquo;rent. I might
be like Lindy Wixon now. She don&rsquo;t have any queer
notions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked her once if she wouldn&rsquo;t like to visit the
star that&rsquo;s so bright in the evenin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; she stared
like she thought I was loony, honest she did.&rdquo; Then,
stooping, the girl laughingly peered into the troubled
eyes beneath the shaggy grey brows. &ldquo;How would
yo&rsquo; like to change gals, Grand-dad? I kin&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belay there, fust mate. That tack&rsquo;s crazier than
the fust.&rdquo; Then lifting a listening ear, he added:
&ldquo;The wind&rsquo;s rising. I reckon the big storm is crusin&rsquo;
this way arter all.&rdquo; But Captain Ezra was
wrong, for, although the wind blew a gale and the
leaden clouds were hurled low above the light and
the rain now and then fell in wind-driven sheets,
changing at times to hail that rattled against the
windows, still the tempest that often came in the
fall was delayed. Perhaps, indeed, as the captain
began to hope, it was not coming at all that year,
for, whenever it had passed, it had taken its toll of
lives and boats, however faithfully the warning light
flashed its beacon rays out through the storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>There was a week of inclement weather, and
Muriel often stood in the warm kitchen looking out
across the waters of the bay that were sometimes
black under the sudden squalls and sometimes livid
green when the sun and rain were struggling together
for mastery, but the girl&rsquo;s thoughts were not
of the weather but of what might be happening in
Tunkett.</p>
<p>In fancy she looked into the newly adorned cabin
where Captain Barney had lived alone for so many
years, but, try as she might, she could not picture
there the old &ldquo;mither&rdquo; he had so yearned to see.</p>
<p>Then in imagination she visited the glassed-in
veranda of Doctor Winslow&rsquo;s home, but it was
empty and the windows of the house were covered
with heavy wooden blinds.</p>
<p>Shuddering, she turned back into the room to find
that the fire in the stove was dying down. It was
cold; that was why she was shivering, she decided.
Maybe her grand-dad was right. She was becoming
too fanciful.</p>
<p>Putting on an armful of dry driftwood, she began
to sing as she prepared the evening meal, and her old
grandfather, who came down the spiral stairs, having
set the light to whirling, felt cheered when he
heard the musical voice of his &ldquo;gal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>The next morning, to the joy of Muriel, there
were only a few vagrant clouds in the sky and the
stars were shining when she arose.</p>
<p>It seemed as though never before had there been
such a glory in the east as there was when Apollo
drove his flaming chariot, the sun, high above the
horizon, once more triumphing over Jupiter Pluvius,
the God of Rain, but of mythology Muriel, as yet,
knew nothing.</p>
<p>What she did know, and it set her heart and
voice to singing an anthem of gladness, was that the
storm was over and that she might sail to Tunkett
and inquire after her dear friends, the old and the
new.</p>
<p>Her grandfather, too, wished to visit the store of
Mrs. Sol, for the supply of oil must be replenished.
It would never do to let it get below a certain depth
in the great tank which contained it, for there might
come a storm of unusual length and fury and the
light must be kept burning.</p>
<p>Muriel felt more optimistic, for we are all somewhat
mercurial for temperament, and it is much
easier to believe that all is well when the sun is shining,
and yet, is not the sun always shining just behind
the clouds that never last?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>At the wharf they parted, the old sea captain going
at once to the store, while Muriel hastened up
the main road toward the home of Dr. Winslow.
As she neared it she suddenly stood still and gazed
her dismay, hardly able to believe what she saw.
&ldquo;Arter all, &rsquo;twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t queer notions,&rdquo; she said in a low
voice. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas true!&rdquo; And indeed it was. The
physician&rsquo;s blinds were barred over the windows.
Doctor Winslow had received word from the hospital
in New York over which he presided that if he
would shorten his vacation this year it would be
greatly appreciated, and as Gene Beavers had gained
strength enough to travel, he had accompanied the
physician.</p>
<p>Miss Brazilla Mullet, from a window of her cottage
on the other side of the low evergreen hedge,
saw Muriel standing as though stunned and she hurried
out with a letter. &ldquo;Gene Beavers left it for you,
Rilly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; he wanted me to tell you that
he&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; stronger, an&rsquo; as soon&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s able to travel
alone he&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; back, if only for a day, to be tellin&rsquo;
you goodbye; but like&rsquo;s not he&rsquo;s told you all that in
the letter.&rdquo; Then, as the air was nippy with frost,
Miss Brazilla hurried indoors again. Rilla placed
the letter in the pocket of her coat and walked back
to meet her grandfather.</p>
<p>Together they had planned to visit the cabin on
the dunes and see Captain Barney, but they did not
go, for, when Muriel beheld her grand-dad emerging
from the store, she knew by his expression that
he, too, had sad news to tell her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need to go to Barney&rsquo;s, fust mate,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not there an&rsquo; the cabin&rsquo;s shut up tight&rsquo;s a clam.
&rsquo;Pears that when he got to Boston and met the incomin&rsquo;
steamer the young priest that was comin&rsquo; over
with his ol&rsquo; mither tol&rsquo; him as how she&rsquo;d been all
ready to start, an&rsquo; then wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t strong enough to make
the v&rsquo;yage. &rsquo;Twas best, the priest said, it bein&rsquo;
stormy all the way, but she&rsquo;d sent word that she&rsquo;d
come in the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s been for years,&rdquo; the girl declared.
&ldquo;But where is Uncle Barney? What did he do?&rdquo;
Rilla&rsquo;s voice was tremulous and eager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He signed articles to sail back on the same boat
as steward, an&rsquo; he had the young priest write to Mrs.
Sol to shut up his cabin but to leave things shipshape
as he&rsquo;d cruise back in the spring and bring his ol&rsquo;
mither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were tears in the eyes of the girl, and, as
she held close to his arm, Captain Ezra felt her
tremble. &ldquo;Grand-dad, we&rsquo;d better be hurryin&rsquo;
home,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The sky&rsquo;s cloudin&rsquo; fast an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
gettin&rsquo; colder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV.
<br />THREE MORE GIRLS.</h2>
<p>Upon reaching Windy Island that cold, grey, late
afternoon, Muriel went at once to her Treasure Cave
to procure the primer which her Uncle Lem had
given her, and by the aid of which she could read
other books and letters containing the simplest words.
This she carried to her room above the kitchen adjoining
the lighthouse. But it was not until the following
morning, when her tasks were finished, that
she was able to slip away to decipher the message
from Gene. A drizzling rain was keeping them
both indoors. The old captain, never content when
he was idle, had brought to the warm kitchen a net
that he was mending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting strong by the day,&rdquo; the little letter
told the girl, &ldquo;and the hope of seeing you very soon
again, Muriel, good friend, helps me more than
anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>What would the girls in his home set have
thought could they have seen that letter which had
been written in the greatest sincerity, for with none
of them did Gene have a serious friendship. They
knew him merely as the good-looking, always good-natured
brother of their favorite, Helen Beavers,
with whom they bantered merrily. Gene liked them
all well enough, but they wearied him with their
constant chatter of tennis tournaments and teas, and
their ceaseless laughter. No wonder that his pal,
David Davison, had often said that most girls seemed
to be afflicted with &ldquo;giggleitis,&rdquo; but not so Muriel.</p>
<p>As Gene sat alone hour after hour in a hospital,
the windows of which looked out across the Hudson,
he thought often of the sweet seriousness of the truly
beautiful face of his &ldquo;storm maiden.&rdquo; Those hazel
eyes had looked into his very soul, and how thankful
he was that he had nothing in that soul that he
wished to conceal.</p>
<p>She had laughed, now and then, spontaneously,
joyfully, but she was very different from the modern
girl who laughed continually because she thought it
becoming. He couldn&rsquo;t conceive of Muriel doing
anything merely to gain admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bully good pal, that&rsquo;s what; so is sis;
but there aren&rsquo;t many girls like those two,&rdquo; was his
conclusion.</p>
<p>Gene had still another month of enforced vacation,
as the doctor had declared that he would not
permit him to return to college until after the holidays.
Under other circumstances the lad would
have fretted about this, but as it was he knew that
he was actually eager to spend at least the larger
part of that month in Tunkett.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>But Gene was not left long alone, for on the very
first Saturday after his arrival in the New York
hospital, his sister Helen and two of her best friends
from the boarding school farther up the Hudson appeared
unexpectedly to visit him.</p>
<p>Gladys Goodsell and Faith Morley were attractive
maidens, clad in fashionably tailored suits, with
muffs to keep their gloved hands warm, for, in spite
of the dazzling brightness of the day, the air was
stingingly cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, brother,&rdquo; Helen protested when she was
told that as soon as he was stronger he was going
back to Tunkett, &ldquo;what <i>can</i> you see in that outlandish
village?&rdquo; Then to her friends she added: &ldquo;I
went down there one week-end with Doctor Winslow,
who is an old friend of father&rsquo;s, but I can
assure you that I shall never go again, that is, not
out of season. Such queer people as I saw! Honestly,
I had to pinch myself to be sure that I hadn&rsquo;t
stepped into one of Joseph Lincoln&rsquo;s stories, and, as
for understanding what the natives said, well, I just
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you didn&rsquo;t try very hard, Sis.&rdquo; This from
the lad who was keeping his new friend a secret in
his heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the merry reply, &ldquo;but if I
were going to write a comic story that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;d
go for my characters and illustrations. Girls, I do
wish you might see the clothes worn by the wives
of the fishermen. I am sure the dressmaker who
made them must have come over in the ark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Gene listened, lying back among the pillows
of his half-reclining-chair, he glanced at the costumes
of his fair visitors, then, turning, he looked
out toward the Hudson, but it was not the steely
blue river that he saw but a girl in a nondescript
calico dress with hair wind-blown who was ordering
him to leave her island. Looking back at his sister,
he said: &ldquo;You are right, Helen, about the clothes.
They are different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When at last the girls arose, Helen leaned affectionately
over her brother&rsquo;s reclining-chair. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what possesses you to want to go to Tunkett
of all places during this coming month.&rdquo; Then,
wheedlingly: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a series of parties
at the school just before the holidays, and then
there&rsquo;s to be that annual affair over at West Point.
Please reconsider, brother dear. Go down for a
week or two if you really think that it will do you
good, but I beg of you, do come back for the holiday
fun. Now, promise me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Gene took the gloved hand of his sister, whom he
did indeed love dearly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise to consider,
sister mine,&rdquo; he said; then added: &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m hardly
in trim for night frolics just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen noticed how pale and suddenly weary her
brother looked and, stooping, she kissed him tenderly
on the forehead as she said softly: &ldquo;Gene, dear, if
you are still in Tunkett, I&rsquo;ll come down there and
spend Christmas with you. Since mother and father
are in Europe, you and I will want to be together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a grateful expression in the lad&rsquo;s eyes
and then he closed them, for he found that he was
indeed very tired.</p>
<p>Helen motioned the girls to leave quietly, which
they did. What would these three city maidens have
thought had they known Gene&rsquo;s real reason for wishing
to return to Tunkett, for surely the village itself
held little to attract one in the severe months of
early winter?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI.
<br />AN EXPECTED SURPRISE.</h2>
<p>The weather clerk may have been purposely perplexing
during those first days of December, for,
after having imprisoned Rilla and her grandfather
on Windy Island for two long, inclement weeks,
they awakened one morning to find a gleaming blue
sky that merged on the far horizon with the deeper
turquoise of the ocean.</p>
<p>A fortnight had passed since she had received the
letter from Gene, and yet he had not come. Because
of the rains, Rilla and her grandfather had
not again visited the town. There was oil enough
in the tank to last another month, nor was there
anyone in Tunkett whom they wished to see.</p>
<p>Of course, there had been no mail, for little Sol
had sailed close to the island one day and Rilla, hailing
him, had asked him to bring the letters if any
should arrive. She was expecting two, one from
Gene and one from Uncle Barney, and indeed her
kind Uncle Lem now and then wrote to her or sent
a picture postcard of some interesting building or
park in the great city where he resided ten months
out of every year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>But the heart of Rilla was filled with a joyful
anticipation on that first sparkling day after the
storms. As soon as her tasks indoors were finished
she called to her shaggy playfellow and, donning her
crimson tam and sweater-coat, away she raced toward
the outer cliff. There she paused and seemed
to be watching for someone or something.</p>
<p>A moment later, her eyes gladdened and she
leaned forward eagerly. A flock of gleaming white-winged
seagulls appeared and Muriel, taking from
her pocket a paper bag, opened it and tossed a fragment
of bread into the air. Instantly there was a
rush of wings and the birds circled and swooped
about her, catching the bits of food as they fell.
Now and then a piece dropped far down the cliff
and two or three birds would dive through the air,
each hoping to be the first to obtain it.</p>
<p>When the bag was empty Muriel turned to find
Shags lying some distance back of her, his head low
on his paws, his limpid brown eyes watching every
move that she made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Muriel had taught him that he must be very quiet
when she was feeding the birds, but when she tossed
the crumpled bag out upon the breeze and stood
watching it fall into the sea, Shags seemed to know
that he need be still no longer. Leaping to his feet,
he joined his mistress and then together they raced
along on the top of the cliff to the side of the island
nearest the town. Again the girl paused, this time
shading her eyes as she gazed out over the dancing
blue waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s a sail comin&rsquo;, Shagsie, ol&rsquo; dog,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but that&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; onusual. &rsquo;Pears like I&rsquo;m &rsquo;spectin&rsquo;
somethin&rsquo; to happen every day, when it used to
be nothin&rsquo; ever happened, much, that was different.
I cal&rsquo;late that it&rsquo;s some fisherman late in startin&rsquo; for
the Outer Ledge. Sam Peters, like as not. He&rsquo;s
powerful shiftless when it comes to gettin&rsquo; started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, nevertheless, as the girl sauntered around
the top of the cliff and toward the light, she glanced
often at the sailboat which seemed to be bearing
directly toward Windy Island.</p>
<p>At last her expression of hopeful eagerness
changed to one of radiant certainty. &ldquo;Shagsie,&rdquo; she
cried exultantly, &ldquo;it <i>is</i> little Sol&rsquo;s boat, arter all. I
reckon he&rsquo;s fetchin&rsquo; some mail. Come on, ol&rsquo; dog.
Let&rsquo;s race to the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl and dog ran joyfully along the top of the
cliff, but at the top of the steep flight of stairs that
led to the beach Rilla paused and looked intently at
the boat, which, ahead of a brisk wind, was scudding
into port.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s some-un else in it,&rdquo; she said in a low
voice, &ldquo;and&mdash;and, oh-o, Shagsie, it <i>is</i> Gene Beavers.
He&rsquo;s come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passenger in little Sol&rsquo;s sailboat was indeed
the lad whom Rilla had expected. When he landed
on the small and mossy dock over which the waves
often washed he was met by a girl whose beautiful
face reminded him of sunrise, so radiant was the expression
shining there, but, after little Sol had been
paid and told to return promptly at five, the girl&rsquo;s
joy at the arrival of her friend changed to alarm
when she noted how very pale he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; oughtn&rsquo;t to&rsquo;ve made the v&rsquo;yage yet, I
reckon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; look all tuckered out. Why
did Uncle Lem let yo&rsquo; come so soon? Yo&rsquo;d ought
t&rsquo; be in bed still, that&rsquo;s whar yo&rsquo;d ought t&rsquo; be, Gene
Beavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storm Maiden, stop scolding me! A fine welcome
you&rsquo;re giving me. I thought&mdash;I hoped that
you might be pleased to see me, and now I&rsquo;m almost
afraid that you&rsquo;re going to set your dog on me.&rdquo;
This was said teasingly, but it was answered by a
reproachful expression in the clear hazel eyes of the
girl.</p>
<p>Then, as Captain Ezra, at that moment, appeared
at the top of the steep steps, the lad went up two at
a time, perhaps with some idea of showing Muriel
how strong he really was, but he had overestimated
his strength, for when the top was reached the captain&rsquo;s
strong arms were all that kept him from falling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; the old man said, &ldquo;what in tarnal creation
are yo&rsquo; cruisin&rsquo; around for in rough water wi&rsquo; yer
mast broken and yer rudder gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad looked up from the bench outside of the
light to which the captain had led him. &ldquo;Am I that
much of a wreck?&rdquo; he asked, smiling whimsically.
Then he confessed: &ldquo;I believe I had overestimated
my strength. Lying there all day I had no way of
telling how weak I really was. I used to get so tired
of doing nothing and I thought if only I could get
back here where the salt air is so exhilarating maybe
I&rsquo;d get strong sooner, but I&rsquo;d better be taking the
train back tonight, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel had gone at once to the kitchen and had a
roaring fire in the stove and the kettle on to boil
when the old man and the lad entered.</p>
<p>How Gene laughed, a little later, when, having
been made comfortable in a high-backed wooden
rocker, which had been drawn close to the fire, his
&ldquo;storm maiden&rdquo; again handed him a thick cup filled
with a steaming beverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and I seem destined to
have morning teas together. Do you recall our first
one down on the beach when you threatened to
shoot me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>The girl whirled about and put her finger to her
lips; then glancing at her grandfather, whose back
was toward them, she said in a low voice: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;
tell that. I don&rsquo; know what possessed me that day.
I reckon I was that angered, bein&rsquo; as yo&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t
take orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mind you from now on forever after, Muriel,
good friend,&rdquo; the lad began. Then added with sudden
seriousness: &ldquo;I realize from my recent misadventures
that I am not possessed of any too sound
a judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A happy day they had, although Gene spent nearly
all of it in the rocker near the fire.</p>
<p>As the clock chimed the hour of four, the lad arose
as he said: &ldquo;I ought to be getting back to town. I
would better take the evening train if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Ezra gently pushed the lad down into the
chair. &ldquo;Tarnation sakes!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Do yo&rsquo;
reckon I&rsquo;d let a friend of Doctor Lem&rsquo;s leave this
craft with underpinnin&rsquo;s as shaky as yours are?
Not by a long sight! Yo&rsquo; oughtn&rsquo;t to&rsquo;ve come, but,
bein&rsquo; as yo&rsquo;re here yo&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to stay a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the boy confessed. &ldquo;But Doctor Winslow
does not even know that I came. He was to be gone
for a few days and so I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>The old sea captain grunted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll know soon
enough. When little Sol comes, give him a message
for his ma to wire back to the big city. Tell Doctor
Lem that yo&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to try Rilla&rsquo;s nursin&rsquo; for a
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If there was a twinkle in the grey eyes of the old
man, there was also a heaviness in his heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII.
<br />THE BLUE JEWELS.</h2>
<p>Gene Beavers received a night-letter from Doctor
Winslow on the following day, and it contained
its full quota of words. The sentiment of it was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You scamp, you ought to be well chastised for
running away, but, after all, Nurse Rilla may be
able to do more for you than your old Uncle Lem,
so stay as long as Ezra Bassett will keep you. Learn
to tend the light so that you may be of use if the
need arises.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;May I?&rdquo; Gene asked, looking up eagerly from
the letter into the face of the old man, who sat near
the stove, cap pulled well down over his eyes, smoking
hard on his corncob pipe.</p>
<p>There was a struggle going on in the heart of
Captain Ezra. Here was one of those city chaps
who for years he had hated on general principles
settling down in his home, it would seem, to be a
boarder for an indefinite length of time. Then another
thought presented itself as the captain noticed
how frail the lad really was, and he questioned his
own heart: &ldquo;What if &rsquo;twas yo&rsquo;re boy needin&rsquo; some-un
to help him get strong, Ezra Bassett? How
would yo&rsquo; want him to be treated? Turned out and
let to drift on the rocks, maybe? I snum&mdash;No!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>The old man rose and vigorously shook the ashes
down from the stove before he replied: &ldquo;Sure, yo&rsquo;
can be larnin&rsquo; all thar is to know about the light, I
reckon, if &rsquo;twould interest yo&rsquo;, son, but Lem knows
I&rsquo;m jealous of that big lamp. I won&rsquo;t even let Rilly
gal polish up the lens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, her face flushed from the heat of the
stove, where she stood frying fish and potatoes in a
big black skillet, laughed over her shoulder as she
said: &ldquo;I reckon Grand-dad loves the lamp better&rsquo;n
he does me, I reckon he does!&rdquo; Then it was that
the expression of infinite tenderness which Gene had
noticed before appeared in the eyes of the old man
as he replied earnestly: &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; this world
holds that I love better&rsquo;n you, fust mate&rdquo;; then he
added, in another tone, &ldquo;An&rsquo;, you rascal, you
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gene slept on a cot in the kitchen, and as the days
passed his strength rapidly returned. The weather
continued sunny and bracing and although it was
nearing the holiday season the midwinter blizzards
had not arrived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Muriel had told the lad all about the treasure box
in her cave. A week after the arrival of the boy on
Windy Island they were climbing about on the cliffs
when they found themselves near the small opening
to the cave. &ldquo;Come on in. I&rsquo;ll show yo&rsquo; the box,&rdquo;
Rilla said.</p>
<p>Gene, really curious concerning the treasure that
had been given up by the sea, went in and watched
with interest as the girl lifted the mirror-lined cover
of what he recognized to be a water-tight steamer
trunk of foreign make.</p>
<p>The sea-green dress, he agreed, was wonderful.
&ldquo;I judge that it is Parisian,&rdquo; he said. Then, as he
saw the question in her hazel eyes, he told about the
City of Paris, where he had been the summer before.
He described the beautiful shops, the lights, the damsels,
and the rare and exquisite fabrics from which
their gowns were fashioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon this box belongs to one of those beautiful
ladies,&rdquo; Muriel said at last.</p>
<p>Gene nodded. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a doubt about it,&rdquo; he
agreed. &ldquo;Have you looked through it thoroughly
to see if you could find the name of the owner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her red-brown head. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;lated
thar&rsquo;d been a wreck, for &rsquo;twas a high storm as sent
this box in. &rsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t hereabouts, but I reckon it
was far out at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly you are right, Muriel, but let&rsquo;s look
for some possible clue as to the former owner&rsquo;s identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad and the girl, as eager as two children, were
on their knees in the soft sand of the cave. The
dress had been carefully laid to one side. A small
box of exquisite workmanship was found and when
the cover was lifted the girl uttered an exclamation
of joy, and in the dim light Gene thought her eyes
like stars.</p>
<p>No wonder that Muriel was elated, for in that
box there was a set of jewels of the most entrancing
blue. Never had she seen anything just like it in the
sea or in the sky. It seemed to be alive, that color!
There was a necklace of them and two lantern-like
earrings, a brooch and a ring.</p>
<p>Muriel gazed at them awed by their loveliness, her
hands tight clasped. As Gene watched her, he
wished that all girls might be as utterly unconscious
of self as she was. Not a move did she ever make
to attract him. She was as natural in all that she
did as were the seagulls that circled over the cliff.</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by Muriel, who
looked up with a troubled expression in her eyes.
&ldquo;Gene,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t right for me to keep &rsquo;em.
They aren&rsquo;t mine, and I cal&rsquo;late they&rsquo;re wurth a
power o&rsquo; money. Aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy nodded. &ldquo;A fortune, I judge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to give &rsquo;em back to the gal as lost &rsquo;em,
if I knew who &rsquo;twas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gene had idly lifted from the jewel case a locket
and had opened it. On one side was the portrait of
a proud, beautiful girl, and on the other was a picture
of himself. He snapped it shut and, replacing
it in the box, he rose rather abruptly, saying:
&ldquo;Muriel, let&rsquo;s finish our search for the owner&rsquo;s name
at some future time. Shall we? You know we
started out to dig clams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel was rather surprised, but as her patient did
seem weary, she replaced the green dress and went
with him to the beach below.</p>
<p>Gene wanted time to think.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII.
<br />MEMORIES.</h2>
<p>The next morning Captain Ezra asked Gene if he
would like to go to the Outer Ledge and spend the
day fishing, as the supply in the barrel was getting
low. The lad was glad to go, and, as Muriel had
baking to do, she was equally pleased to be alone.</p>
<p>Long, silent hours these were for Gene as he sat
with the captain waiting for the coming of the fish
that seemed reluctant to be caught in the early morning.
Long, thoughtful hours. Now and then the
lad even forgot where he was until a wave, larger
than the others, rocked the boat and recalled to him
his whereabouts. He was living over again a chapter
in his past.</p>
<p>It had happened the summer before. His dear
mother, who was perfect in every other way, had
one obsession (many mothers seemed to have it, he
concluded), and that was that she wanted the idol of
her heart, her only son, to make a fashionable marriage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>During their last vacation, with his sister Helen,
he had joined his parents in Paris, where Mr.
Beavers was employed as resident representative of
large American interests, he himself having a controlling
share.</p>
<p>Mrs. Beavers had suggested a jaunt about the continent
and had joined a small exclusive party, one
of the younger members of it being just the sort of
a girl she desired as a comrade for her son.</p>
<p>Marianne Carnot, the descendant of a long line of
illustrious French folk, had been educated in London
and although she was a dark, sparkling beauty of
the French type, she spoke excellent English with a
delightful accent which but added to her charm.</p>
<p>Gene&rsquo;s mother, in her eagerness to interest her son
in this girl (for Monsieur Carnot was a diplomat
of fabulous wealth), had been truly discouraged, for
they had neither of them cared greatly (or so it
would seem) to be in each other&rsquo;s company. When
the pleasant journey through Italy, Switzerland and
France was ended, Mrs. Beavers could not see that
the two most frequently in her thoughts had been
greatly impressed with each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>They had come to the parting of their ways and
Gene had never again seen Marianne nor had they
corresponded. But the locket! How had Marianne
procured the snapshot of him? Then he recalled one
day in Rome when she had told him to stand by a
famous statue and look his prettiest. He had supposed
that a photograph of the statue was what she
had really wished to procure, but he had been mistaken,
evidently. Could it have been that Marianne
had liked him especially? He was sure that this
was not true. He also recalled that his mother had
assured Mademoiselle Carnot that she ought to spend
at least one year in an American boarding school.
Evidently the French girl had been voyaging across
the great Atlantic when her small steamer trunk had
been lost.</p>
<p>Did that mean that Marianne had also met with
disaster?</p>
<p>He decided that he would write his sister at once
and inquire if she knew aught of her friend of the
summer before.</p>
<p>When Gene reached Windy Island that night,
upon one thing he had decided. He would tell
Muriel the entire story. The next morning an opportunity
presented itself. The girl was darning in
the sunny kitchen when Gene came in from the shed
on the shore where he and Captain Ezra had been
cleaning fish and packing it away in the barrel which
was kept very cold in a wet hole in the sand.</p>
<p>Muriel looked up with a welcoming smile. Just
such a smile was ever awaiting the coming of her
grand-dad.</p>
<p>Gene sat upon the broad arm of a chair nearby
and twirled his cap. &ldquo;Muriel, good friend,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I know to whom your box belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>The girl looked up amazed, not understanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gene, how could yo&rsquo;? We didn&rsquo;t find a name or
nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we found something. That is, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those hazel eyes were again looking into the very
soul of the boy, but he did not flinch. He had done
nothing of which he was ashamed.</p>
<p>He slid down into the chair, and leaning forward,
looked directly back at her. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you at
once, because I wanted to think it all over. I was
so surprised I couldn&rsquo;t quite understand myself what
it could mean, but I do now, in part at least. May I
tell you the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded and her hands lay idly in her lap,
though still holding the sock she had been darning.</p>
<p>Gene told her all from the beginning. He wondered
what her first remark would be when he
paused. It was: &ldquo;I reckon yo&rsquo;re mother wouldn&rsquo;t
wish yo&rsquo; to be friends with me, Gene Beavers. I
cal&rsquo;late yo&rsquo;d better go back to the city soon, to the
kind of folks she&rsquo;d want yo&rsquo; to be associatin&rsquo; with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Muriel!&rdquo; The lad had risen, and
thrusting his hands deep in his pockets, he stood
looking out of the window for a long time, silent,
thoughtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX.
<br />THE OWNER OF THE BOX.</h2>
<p>They did not again visit the box in Treasure
Cave. As he had planned, Gene had written a
long letter to his sister telling her that he was getting
strong and well, describing his interesting life
on Windy Island, but Muriel, for some reason, he
did not mention.</p>
<p>He ended his epistle by telling his sister about the
small steamer trunk which had been cast ashore by
a storm and then asked if Helen had heard, lately,
from Marianne Carnot. A week passed and no
reply was received. Gene, growing every day more
rugged and ruddy, had actually forgotten that his
sister had said if he did not return to New York to
spend the holidays with her, that she would visit him.</p>
<p>It was a glorious day, about a week before Christmas,
and the air was invigoratingly cold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll race
yo&rsquo; around the island on the beach,&rdquo; Muriel called,
as she and Gene started out for their customary
morning hike when their tasks were finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t beat,&rdquo; the boy, whose laughing face
was beginning to bronze from the sun and wind,
shouted that his voice might be heard above the
booming of the surf on the rocks near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Muriel turned merrily to defy him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I snum you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Gene liked to borrow words
from the old sea captain&rsquo;s lingo now and then. &ldquo;Nor
will I, for that matter,&rdquo; the lad confessed. &ldquo;Shags
will. Now, one, two, three, go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away they ran. Muriel was quickly in the lead,
Shags bounding at her heels, and the lad a close
third. When they reached the north end of the
island they found that the tide was high, which
meant that they had to await the receding of the
waves before they could round the point on the sand.
Luck was with Muriel, for when she reached the
rocks there was a clear wet space ahead of her and
around she darted, but Gene was held up while another
breaker crashed in, and so, as they neared their
final goal, the little wharf on the town side of the
island, the girl was in the lead.</p>
<p>Her red-brown hair was blown, her cheeks were
flushed, her eyes sparkling, and as she whirled to
exult over the lad, he thought he had never seen a
more beautiful picture. He caught both of her
hands, but his bantering remark died as he stared
at the dock back of Muriel, hardly able to believe
his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My sister Helen has come,&rdquo; he said in a low
voice, &ldquo;and someone is with her.&rdquo; Instantly he
recognized the someone. It was Marianne Carnot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to the light,&rdquo; Muriel told him.
&ldquo;Yo&rsquo;re sister&rsquo;ll want to see yo&rsquo; alone, an&rsquo; she won&rsquo;t
care for the like o&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gene leaped to her side when the girl turned
away. &ldquo;Muriel Storm,&rdquo; he said, and there was a
note of ringing sincerity in his voice, &ldquo;you are a
princess compared to most girls. Come with me,
please, to greet my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went reluctantly. She recalled what he had
told her about his mother wishing him to care for
this French girl of wealth and family and his sister
Helen would probably feel the same way. Perhaps
they would not be kind to her. How she wanted to
run up to the light to the sheltering arms of her
grandfather. But Gene held her hand in a firm
clasp until they reached the top of the steps leading
to the small wharf; then, releasing her, he went to
greet the newcomers, turning at once to introduce
Muriel. There was indeed a curling of the lips and
a slight if almost imperceptible lifting of the eyebrows,
but the &ldquo;storm maiden&rdquo; in Muriel had awakened,
and it was with a proudly held head that she
said: &ldquo;Miss Carnot, I&rsquo;m that glad to be able to
return yo&rsquo;re box, if &rsquo;tis yo&rsquo;r&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed mine,&rdquo; Marianne replied haughtily.
&ldquo;I will bid the man who rowed us over to get it, if
you will tell him where it is. Later you shall receive
the reward which my father offered for the
return of my trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel, her cheeks burning, was nevertheless
about to comply when Gene leaped forward, saying:
&ldquo;I will show the oarsman where the trunk is, Rilla.
You need not come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luckily, at that moment the island girl heard her
grandfather&rsquo;s voice booming her name from the
door of the light. Gene heard it, too, and he was
glad that it offered his &ldquo;storm maiden&rdquo; an escape
from further humiliation which he was powerless
to prevent.</p>
<p>Later, when the trunk had been placed in the
boat, and when Marianne was looking through its
contents to be sure that nothing had been removed
or ruined, Helen took the opportunity of speaking
alone with her brother. She was truly glad to note
that his health had been restored and she implored
him to return with her for the holidays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, brother,&rdquo; Helen said, &ldquo;you are strong
enough now, and since it was to gain your strength
that you came, why should you remain any longer?
Gladys and Faith told me not to return without you.
They both like to dance with you, and Marianne, I
know has been eager to see you. She is hurt, I can
tell, because you pay her so little attention today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>Then glancing toward the lighthouse, where
Muriel was standing close to her grand-dad, Helen
added in a lower voice: &ldquo;Of course, I know there
is nothing serious in this companionship, Gene, but
what would our mother say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What, indeed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I shall be returning soon,&rdquo; was all
that he would say, &ldquo;as I want to be back at college
by the beginning of the winter term.&rdquo; Gene
spent a long, thoughtful hour alone on the cliff when
his sister and the proud Marianne were gone.
Muriel was busy preparing the noon meal, but she,
too, was thoughtful. Her friend was well enough
now to return to the city and ought she not urge
him to go? Just before the visitors had been rowed
over to Tunkett, Helen had ascended the flight of
stairs leading to the light, and, taking the hand of
the girl who lived there, she had said, almost pleadingly:
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you please advise my brother to
come home for the holidays? I can&rsquo;t stay with him
here and it&rsquo;s going to be so lonely for me with
mother and father away. I would go to them, but
the vacation at midwinter will be too short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were tears in the eyes that looked at Muriel
with the same frank, candid expression that was
also her brother&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon he should be goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Muriel had answered.
&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late he&rsquo;s strong enough now, and
he&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; to get back to college arter a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Helen had smiled her gratitude, and pressing the
slim brown hand that she held in her own, that was
gloved, she had said hurriedly: &ldquo;Thank you, Miss
Muriel. Please don&rsquo;t tell brother that I made this
request. He might feel that I was interfering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she had added, &ldquo;I know <i>our</i> mother would
wish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen, ever considerate and kind, did not mean
what Muriel believed that she did. There was a
deep crimson flush in the cheeks of the island girl,
but just at that moment Marianne had appeared at
the top of the stairs to coldly announce that she was
ready to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; Helen had called. Then, because
she was too much like her brother not to ring true,
she held out her hand again to Muriel and had said
most sincerely: &ldquo;I want to thank you and your
grandfather for having done so much toward restoring
Gene&rsquo;s health. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll be glad when they&rsquo;re all gone,&rdquo;
Muriel thought, the flush again creeping to her
cheeks. &ldquo;If Grand-dad an&rsquo; I aren&rsquo;t good enough to
be associated with I cal&rsquo;late when Gene comes in,
I&rsquo;ll tell him he must be goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later she heard his clear, merry
whistle as he rounded the house. To his surprise,
when he entered the kitchen, she did not turn to greet
him with her usual friendly smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Had those girls made his &ldquo;storm maiden&rdquo; self-conscious?
was his first almost wrathful thought.
Throwing his cap to a chair near, he leaped to the
kitchen table, where the girl stood busily stirring a
cornmeal mixture for baking. The lad saw the
flushed cheeks and at once he understood. Catching
her hands, regardless of the spoon, he whirled her
about. &ldquo;Storm Maiden,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what did Marianne
Carnot say that has hurt you?&rdquo; He felt, as a
brother might, he assured himself, a desire to fight
the world to defend this girl. The quivering lips
smiled just a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Then Rilla added:
&ldquo;Gene, I&rsquo;ve been ponderin&rsquo; while yo&rsquo;ve been out, an&rsquo;
I reckon yo&rsquo;d better go back to the city now. I
cal&rsquo;late maybe&mdash;maybe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; How she dreaded to
hurt him, but she had decided that he must go, but
she did not have to finish the sentence.</p>
<p>Gene turned away and took up his cap. &ldquo;Very
well, Muriel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I promised to mind every
command, and if this is one of them, I&rsquo;ll go tomorrow.&rdquo;
Captain Ezra secretly rejoiced when he heard
that the lad was soon to depart. It was hard for him
to share his &ldquo;gal.&rdquo; He liked Gene, to be sure, better
than he did any boy he had ever known. In fact, he
hadn&rsquo;t supposed &ldquo;city folk&rdquo; could be so genuine;
willing to clean fish or turn a hand to anything however
commonplace. To be sure Doctor Winslow
might be called &ldquo;city folks,&rdquo; for he had spent most
of his time in New York for nearly thirty years, but
when all was said, he was really a native of Tunkett.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Muriel tried to laugh and chatter during the meal
that followed, but Gene found it hard to do so. He
was still feeling rebellious. He was so sure Marianne
Carnot had hurt his &ldquo;storm maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She should have remained in Europe if she
does not approve of American democracy,&rdquo; his indignant
thought was declaring. &ldquo;But in Muriel she
has met her superior,&rdquo; another thought championed,
adding: &ldquo;I hope the future will prove it and humiliate
her snobbishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Gene&rsquo;s departure the delayed blizzard arrived
with unusual fury. The mountainous waves
crashed against the rocks as though determined to
undermine the light, high on the cliff above them;
but when each fuming, frothing wave had receded
the tower, strong and unshaken, stood in the midst
of driving hail and wet snow, but its efforts to
shine were of little avail, for its great lamp could
merely cast a halo of glow and a small circle of
light out into the storm.</p>
<p>Woe to the mariners, if any there were, who went
too near the Outer Ledge while the blizzard raged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rilly gal, I cal&rsquo;late yer city friend got away jest
in time,&rdquo; Captain Ezra said on the third day of the
blizzard, which had continued with unabated fury.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;d be tarnal risky navigatin&rsquo; tryin&rsquo; to cruise him
over to Tunkett today, which was when he cal&rsquo;lated
leavin&rsquo;, wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it, fust mate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old sea captain sat by the stove, smoking. It
was warm and cheerful in the kitchen, but with each
fresh blast of wind the house shook, while the very
island itself seemed to tremble now and then as an
unusually large wave crashed over it on the seaward
side.</p>
<p>Muriel turned to look out of the window toward
the town, but all that she could see was the grey,
sleeting, wind-driven rain.</p>
<p>Turning back into the warm kitchen, she took her
darning basket and sat near the stove. After a
thoughtful moment, she spoke: &ldquo;I reckon things
allays happen for the best,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s
hard for us to see it that way jest at fust; but later
on, we do. &rsquo;Pears thar&rsquo;s a plan, Grand-dad, and if
so, then thar&rsquo;s Some-un doin&rsquo; the plannin&rsquo;. If we
really believe that, then we won&rsquo;t be worryin&rsquo; and
frettin&rsquo; about how things&rsquo;ll turn out; we&rsquo;ll jest be
content, <i>knowin&rsquo;</i> that somehow they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; out
for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The keen grey eyes of the old man were intently
watching the girl, who, all unconscious of his scrutiny,
sat with red-brown head bent over her darning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late yo&rsquo;re right, fust mate,&rdquo; he said at last.
&ldquo;It makes the v&rsquo;yage seem a tarnal lot safer if yo&rsquo;re
sure thar&rsquo;s a skipper in command that&rsquo;s not goin&rsquo; to
let yo&rsquo; wreck yer craft on the rocks. Like be you&rsquo;ll
sail in purty rough waters sometimes, but I cal&rsquo;late
thar&rsquo;s allays a beacon light shinin&rsquo; clear and steady
through the storm o&rsquo; life, waitin&rsquo; to guide you to a
safe harbor if yo&rsquo;re watchin&rsquo; for it and willin&rsquo; to be
guided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the grey eyes of Captain Ezra began to
twinkle. &ldquo;Rilly gal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I reckon Parson
Thompkins over to Tunkett&rsquo;d think we was tryin&rsquo;
to have a meetin&rsquo; without him presidin&rsquo; at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled across at the old man whom she
loved. Then, rolling two socks together, she arose
to prepare the noon meal.</p>
<p>The captain tilted back his chair. &ldquo;The sermon
now bein&rsquo; concluded,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time for
the singin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a clear, sweet voice Muriel sang his favorite
of the meeting-house hymns. Peace and joy were
within that humble home while the tempest raged
without. But that night, when she was snug in her
bed in her room over the kitchen, Muriel lay awake
for a long time listening to the roar of the storm
and the crash of the surf and tried to picture what
her friend Gene was doing at that hour.</p>
<p>But his world was not her world and the island
girl could not even imagine the gayety into which
Helen and Gladys and Faith had lured him that New
Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX.
<br />NEW YEAR&rsquo;S EVE.</h2>
<p>The street lights in New York were barely distinguishable
because of the storm which raged for
many miles north and south along the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>There were few pedestrians out, although it was
still early evening, and but a scattering of closed
vehicles. In one of these sat Helen Beavers, Marianne
Carnot and Gene. The French girl shivered
and drew her costly grey furs closer about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is your winter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I would like
it better in the south where it is always summer.&rdquo;
She shrugged her slim shoulders and tried to peer
out of the small, rain-drenched window.</p>
<p>The skidding car was turning into a fashionable
side street. Soon they were gliding up the drive of
a private residence. They stopped under a wide,
sheltering portico and when the door was flung aside
Gene leaped to the pavement to help the girls alight.</p>
<p>Brights lights burned within a handsome grey
stone house, and a moment later the door was
opened to admit them into a festive scene where
there was youth and music, laughter and joy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>It was the home of Faith Morley&rsquo;s Aunt Louise,
and this was one of the parties to attend which the
girls had begged Gene to return to the big city.</p>
<p>An hour later when he had danced, first with
Faith, his hostess, and then with Helen and Gladys
Goodsell, he went in search of Marianne, whom he
found talking with a tall, lank youth in military uniform.
The proud girl paid scant attention to the
newcomer. Gene, knowing that it was his duty, if
not his pleasure, to ask each of his sister&rsquo;s friends
to dance with him, waited until there was a pause in
their conversation before making the request. The
French girl thanked him effusively, of course, but
declined, saying that she did not dance the old-fashioned
American waltz. Then she turned back
to the young cadet, who, if the truth were known,
was boring her exceedingly. Gene excused himself
and, seemingly unnoticed, walked away.</p>
<p>The slow, dreamy waltz music was being played
by the palm-hidden orchestra and as it was the only
dance for which Gene cared, he sought his sister,
but was just in time to see her glide away with his
pal, David Davison. He did not care to dance with
anyone else. He felt too weary to be entertaining
and so he slipped across the hall into the dimly
lighted library, where a log was burning on the
wide hearth, casting its warm glow over the low
bookshelves and the statues and beautiful paintings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>He was glad no one was there. He wanted to be
alone, to rest, he assured himself. But what he
really wished was to remember.</p>
<p>He sank down into the big, comfortable chair in
front of the fire which had recently been deserted by
Mr. Morley. An open book and a magazine lay
nearby.</p>
<p>How good it seemed to be away from the noise,
if laughter and chatter and music could be called by
a name so plebian.</p>
<p>Then he listened to the other sounds as he sank
deeper into the soft depths of the chair and relaxed,
stretching out before the warmth of the blaze.</p>
<p>How the storm whistled and moaned about the
house and down the chimney. Closing his eyes, he
tried to picture what the storm would be like about
Tunkett. He glanced at the small clock over the
mantle. Ten-thirty. The house adjoining the tower
would be in darkness, but the great lamp would be
swinging. Perhaps the blizzard was keeping Muriel
awake, and he wondered what she might be thinking
about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Just then he happened to recall what his sister had
said to him that morning, and, knowing Helen, he
also knew that she had meant it kindly. Putting her
hands on his shoulders, she had looked into his eyes,
saying: &ldquo;Dear brother, you wouldn&rsquo;t allow yourself
to care for someone of whom your mother could
not be proud. This friend of yours, Muriel Storm,
is a fine girl, I am sure, but she could not associate
with your friends, and our mother&rsquo;s heart would be
broken if you really cared for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course he and Muriel did not care for each
other in the way to which Helen had referred. They
were just jolly good comrades.&rsquo; Why were people
always romancing? He was glad that Muriel did
not fit into the scene that was being enacted in the
brilliantly lighted room across the hall. He liked
her best as she was.</p>
<p>At midnight his sister found him and her glance
was reproachful at first, but when she saw how
truly weary he looked she rebuked herself for having
kept him up late so soon after his illness.</p>
<p>She remembered how solicitous Muriel had been
that he should not overwork. Was she, Helen, less
considerate as a sister than this island girl as a
friend?</p>
<p>When they were again in the closed car, Marianne
retired into the depth of her furs and ignored
their existence, pretending that she was too weary
for conversation, but Helen understood.</p>
<p>Marianne, she knew, wished all boys to think her
the most charming girl they had ever met, and
though Gene was polite, he had not been devoted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor brother,&rdquo; Helen thought, as she glanced at
his face, pale in spite of its recent tanning. Aloud
she said: &ldquo;Gene, this is the last night that I am
going to drag you around to a dance. I know that
you ought to just rest, if you are to go back to college
next month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gene said nothing, but reached for his sister&rsquo;s
hand and held it in a loving clasp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI.
<br />CHRISTMAS IN FEBRUARY.</h2>
<p>It was the first week in February before Captain
Ezra thought it wise for him to cross the turbulent
waters of the bay. It was indeed necessary for him
to make the voyage then, as the oil had dropped to
what he called &ldquo;low tide mark,&rdquo; and after that the
faithful keeper of the light never delayed longer
than necessary before refilling the tank.</p>
<p>The wind had subsided and the sun came out, revealing
the island white with drifts of snow, and,
too, there was ice on the stairs leading down to the
little wharf. The ever-thoughtful Muriel, upon
hearing her grand-dad say that he must go down and
get the dory out of the boathouse, skipped ahead
with a kettle of boiling water, and, after thawing
the ice, swept the steps dry that her grand-dad might
not slip.</p>
<p>The old man, coming out of the house just then,
his fur cap drawn over his ears and his red knitted
muffler tied about his neck, looked lovingly at the
girl who always seemed to be planning something
for his comfort or happiness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Why, just then, he should have thought of
Muriel&rsquo;s father whom he had &ldquo;robbed,&rdquo; as Barney
put it, he could not have told. What that father had
lost no one knew better than Captain Ezra. &ldquo;Ho!
Rilly gal, yo&rsquo;ve swabbed the decks clean, I snum.&rdquo;
Then he added: &ldquo;Fust mate, I cal&rsquo;late yo&rsquo;d better
get under cover. It&rsquo;s cold enough to freeze a volcano,
&rsquo;pears like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, his breath frosted on the nipping air.
The girl, rosy cheeked, was without hat or coat, and
so, kissing her grand-dad on the tip of his nose (little
else was visible) and telling him not to slip, and
to be sure to bring her a pocketful of letters, she
darted indoors.</p>
<p>She felt radiantly happy that glorious morning,
and if she had been familiar with the poems of
Robert Browning she would have sung, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s in
His Heaven; all&rsquo;s right with the world!&rdquo; But, instead,
her wordless song reverberated through the
small house until her tasks were finished; then, putting
on her leggins, her crimson tam and sweater-coat,
and taking a small bag of bread crumbs, she
waded through the snow to the cliff to try to find
her feathered friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>She called and waited, soon calling again. Then
from out a sheltered cave in a cliff nearby they came,
circling about her in the clear, crisp air, uttering
their discordant cries, which, however, were music
to the ears of the girl, who knew that they were
notes of joy and welcome to the friend who fed
them through the bitter cold months of winter when
fish were scarce and hard to catch.</p>
<p>Muriel did not toss the fragments of bread this
time, for she knew if she did so they would sink into
the soft depths of snow and be lost; and so she
brushed a rock clear and placed the feast upon it.
Down the birds swooped, unafraid. It was too cold
to remain long out of doors, and moreover Muriel
wished to have a nice hot dinner awaiting the coming
of her grand-dad.</p>
<p>An appetizing odor of coffee and sizzling bacon
greeted the old man when, two hours later, he
opened the door and entered the kitchen. The girl,
flushed of cheek and eager-eyed, turned to greet him.
&ldquo;Any mail, Grand-dad?&rdquo; Muriel&rsquo;s heart was pounding
fast when she asked the question.</p>
<p>The old man laughed as he thrust his hand into
the deep pocket of his leather coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sol said that if I hadn&rsquo;t cruised to town today
she was of nine minds to hire the lighter to
fetch yer mail over. She was feared the floor of her
store&rsquo;d heave in with the weight of it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s excited laughter rang out. &ldquo;Oh,
Grand-dad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why does your coat bulge
so queer like? I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;ve fetched somethin&rsquo;
hid under it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>She pounced upon him and drew forth the bulgy
something, which proved to be a large square package.
The wrappings were soon removed and there
was the most wonderful book, &ldquo;Treasure Island,&rdquo;
illustrated in the most beautiful blues and greens
and gold. How Muriel loved color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gene sent it,&rdquo; she said, as she lifted the card with
its painted wreath of holly and mistletoe.</p>
<p>But Muriel then had no time to look at the book,
as letters were being produced from that great
pocket. The girl gasped when she saw them and
then she clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand-dad,&rdquo; she exclaimed, unbelievingly, &ldquo;are
they all for me? I reckon Mis&rsquo; Sol did think &rsquo;twas
a powerful lot o&rsquo; mail, bein&rsquo; as I never had more&rsquo;n
one and a card before at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were four letters from Gene, who had written
one each week since he had left Windy Island.
He knew his Storm Maiden could not write and so
he did not expect answers. What he did not know
was that the blizzard had prevented her receiving
them as they arrived each week. There was another
letter from Ireland and a Christmas card and a parcel
from Uncle Lem. There were pretty hair ribbons
in the parcel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas in February,&rdquo; Muriel laughed; then
added: &ldquo;The blizzard sort o&rsquo; got the calendar mixed,
didn&rsquo;t it, Grand-dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Muriel took her new treasures up to her room and
placed them on the top of her chest of drawers.
She sighed as she looked at the letters and longed
to know the messages they contained. It would take
her until spring, she feared, to decipher them, as she
would have to study them word by word with the
aid of the Second Reader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII.
<br />FACING REALITIES.</h2>
<p>March came and April followed. Muriel thought
that never before had there been so lovely a spring.
The returning birds surely sang more wonderful
songs than in the springs that were past. The melting
snow on the cliffs trickled down, forming sparkling
miniature waterfalls. Then, after a warm
spell, out of every crevice in the rocks wild flowers
blossomed.</p>
<p>The girl, running to the highest peak one glorious
morning, flung her arms out toward the sky, letting
the wind blow her red-brown hair as it would, and
if Gene had seen his Storm Maiden at that moment
he would have had a third picture of her that he
would never wish to forget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s glad I am to be livin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said aloud.
&ldquo;The world is so wonderful and friends are so
kind. I&rsquo;m that happy, so happy.&rdquo; The birds, her
birds, were soon circling about her, for, although
there was plenty for them to eat, Muriel fed them
just for the joy of it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I love every one of yo&rsquo;,&rdquo; she told them. &ldquo;An&rsquo;
yo&rsquo;, too, poor ol&rsquo; lame pelican,&rdquo; she called to a larger
bird that descended when the flock of white gulls
had swooped down to the sea, one of them having
sighted a luckless fish that was glinting too near the
surface of the water.</p>
<p>Then, scrambling down to her Treasure Cave,
the girl brought from its hiding place in a crevice
the well-worn Second Reader. Going out on the
sun-flooded ledge, she sat for a moment just gazing
at the sparkling surf that was crashing far beneath
her.</p>
<p>Thrusting her hand into her pocket, she drew
forth a letter bearing the New York postmark. It
was the last that she had received from Gene, having
been left at the lighthouse by little Sol.</p>
<p>Muriel had been in the middle of breadmaking
then, but all the hour she had been filled with eager
anticipation, for in his last letter Gene had told her
that in the spring he was to have a vacation (he had
been at college since the beginning of the midwinter
term), and that even if he could only spare a day for
it, he was going to visit Windy Island.</p>
<p>Muriel, while finishing the baking, had been happily
wondering how her comrade would look after
his month&rsquo;s confinement at his studies. Perhaps the
bronze from the wind and the sun would be worn
away and again he would be pale as he was when she
had first known him. How she hoped not! She
wanted him to keep every bit of the strength he had
gained during his month&rsquo;s visit on Windy Island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Muriel removed the letter, her heart beating rapidly.
She was sure that in it he would tell the day
of his coming. Soon, very soon, she hoped, as she
wished him to see how lovely her rock-ribbed island
home was when the wild flowers blossomed.</p>
<p>During the past months Muriel had become familiar
with many of the simple words that Gene
used in writing to her and she had to refer less frequently
to the well-worn Second Reader.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>With comparative ease she read the few lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Friend Muriel:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped to have good news to tell you today,
but, after all, I am not to have my longed-for visit
with you. Last night Helen received a cablegram
from our father telling us to join them at once in
London, and so we are to depart without delay, as
Dad has reserved passage for us on the steamship
&lsquo;The Liverpool,&rsquo; which leaves its dock tomorrow at
dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear good friend, don&rsquo;t forget me! I don&rsquo;t know
what this command from our father means. I surely
hope that mother is not ill, but, of course, it is a
command which Helen and I must obey. I shall
write you, however, as soon as I reach the other side
of the broad Atlantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your grandfather, please, how grateful I
am and ever shall be to him for having permitted me
to share his home for that wonderful, never-to-be-forgotten
month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel, come what may, believe me when I say
that next to Helen your friendship is dearer to me
than that of any girl whom I know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This letter sounds as though I hardly expect to
come back to the only country under the sun, but
that isn&rsquo;t true. Heaven willing, I&rsquo;ll return when I&rsquo;m
twenty-one, if I have to remain over there until then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Storm Maiden, your closer-than-a-brother
friend,</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Gene</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sun was still shining and the waves sparkling,
the birds still singing and the flowers blooming when
Muriel had deciphered the message in that letter,
but the glory of the day was gone for her and there
was no echo of song in her heart.</p>
<p>She arose, saddened, and after replacing the Second
Reader in its niche, climbed the steep trail up
the cliff and returned to the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII.
<br />THE STORM.</h2>
<p>The wonderful weather continued and, if there
was loneliness in the heart of the girl because her
friend and comrade seemed to be so far, so very far
away, it was unnoticed by the old man who loved
her, for whenever he was near, her clear voice rang
out its sweetest and her welcoming smile always
awaited him.</p>
<p>June came, and Captain Ezra, returning from town
about noon on a day that was a-gleaming with blue
in sky and sea (as only a day in June can be), produced
a letter.</p>
<p>How the girl hoped that it was from her friend
across the water, but, instead, it was from Doctor
Winslow. In it he stated that he was coming to
Tunkett for a week&rsquo;s rest, as he had had a most
strenuous winter, and, since he was not as young as
he had been, he felt the need now and then of a
period of relaxation. He was eager to see his
comrade of boyhood days. He recalled the happy,
carefree times when, barefooted, they had tramped
over the salt meadows, swam together, breasting
even the outer breakers, or had fished, talking quietly
for hours of their plans for the future, which had
proved so unlike.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ez, old pal,&rdquo; the doctor had written, &ldquo;I want
especially to talk over with you something which has
been much in my thoughts of late, and that is the
future of the girl whom you love so dearly and
whom, for that matter, we both love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not as unreasonable now as you formerly
were, and so I again shall broach the subject of
Muriel&rsquo;s education. As I have said before, I wish
to pay her tuition as my share, for am I not her
Uncle Lem?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and I are advanced in years, Ezra, and we&rsquo;re
not always going to be here to protect Muriel.
Think how unfitted she now is to face the world with
no knowledge whatever of its ways; but more of this
later when I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although there was disappointment in the heart
of the girl because the letter had not been from
Gene, she was indeed glad to hear that she was so
soon to see her dear Uncle Lem, as it had been many
months since his town house had been boarded up
and he had departed for the big city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lem&rsquo;s to put into port next Tuesday,&rdquo; the old
man said. &ldquo;I reckon he&rsquo;s right about the iddication
idee. I cal&rsquo;late yo&rsquo;d ought to be gittin&rsquo; some larnin&rsquo;
into that purty head o&rsquo; yo&rsquo;rn. Not but that yo&rsquo;re
suitin&rsquo; me to a &lsquo;T&rsquo; jest as yo&rsquo; are, but Lem knows
best, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>There was a sad note in the voice of the old man
and a suspicion of moisture in the grey eyes that
looked so lovingly at his &ldquo;gal.&rdquo; Quickly he turned
away to hide them. He had been selfish long enough
and life was &ldquo;tarnel unsartin&rdquo; at best.</p>
<p>Then he recalled the long-delayed letter that he
planned writing to Muriel&rsquo;s own father. He had an
address that his daughter had once sent to him, and
in the accompanying note she had written: &ldquo;Dad,
a letter sent here will always reach my husband or
me. Please write that you have forgiven me, for I
do so love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That note from Muriel&rsquo;s girl-mother (with the
address to which they were to write if they wished
to reach her father) was in the iron box hidden in
the tower near the great lamp, the very box of which
Captain Ezra had told Captain Barney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should be tuk sudden-like,&rdquo; the old man had
said, &ldquo;I want yo&rsquo; to go to the tower, get that box,
Barney, an&rsquo; have some-un write to the father o&rsquo; my
gal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Ezra was thinking of these things as he
sat smoking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I snum, I&rsquo;ll get that thar letter written next Sunday
as sure sartin as I&rsquo;m keeper of the light,&rdquo; he
resolved as he rose to go to bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>The next day the first intense heat wave of summer
swept over Tunkett. The air was depressing.
Muriel listlessly went about the tasks of the day. It
seemed an effort even to sing, which she always tried
to do to make the little home more cheerful. Never,
never, should her dear old grand-dad know how
lonely and disappointed she was because Gene had
not even written to her. It was nearing July and
as yet she had not heard of his safe arrival in Liverpool.</p>
<p>Boats did go down, now and then, the girl knew;
and when she thought of this she asked anxiously:
&ldquo;Grand-dad, thar hasn&rsquo;t been a wreck on the seas
anywhar that you&rsquo;ve heard of, has thar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Ezra shook his head. &ldquo;No, Rilly, fust
mate; and I sure sartin hope thar&rsquo;s none comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next evening, when the old man came in to
supper, he reported that the stifling air seemed, if
anything, more hot and breathless, and also that
clouds were gathering rapidly. &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;re
glad o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; was his comment. Then as he stood,
looking out at the deepening twilight, he continued:
&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s heat lit&rsquo;nin&rsquo; over to the west. Like&rsquo;s not
we&rsquo;ll soon have a thunder storm. I sort o&rsquo; hope we
will have one. &rsquo;Twill cool off this stiflin&rsquo; air
an&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned toward him, her face white.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grand-dad,&rdquo; she implored, and her voice
quivered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo; it won&rsquo;t come here with its
crashin&rsquo; an&rsquo; threatenin&rsquo;. I allays seem to hear it say,
&lsquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll get&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man put his hand over the girl&rsquo;s mouth as
he said tenderly: &ldquo;Rilly gal, don&rsquo;t be talkin&rsquo; that
way. What did yo&rsquo;n I say &rsquo;tother day &rsquo;bout thar
bein&rsquo; a skipper at the helm as we could trust. Didn&rsquo;t
yo&rsquo;n I agree that his commands was allays for the
best, whatever they seemed like to us? I reckon
we&rsquo;d better be rememberin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as he looked thoughtfully out at the storm-threatening
sky, he said: &ldquo;Fust mate, hold fast to
that idee like it was your life preserver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel clung to her grandfather, sobbing &ldquo;I will,
Grand-dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smoothed his &ldquo;gal&rsquo;s&rdquo; hair, wondering
vaguely at her fear and evident grief. Doctor
Lem had said that Rilly had a very unusually active
imagination and that they must be patient with her
when they could not understand.</p>
<p>To change the girl&rsquo;s thoughts the old man remarked:
&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose likely as not Lem landed in
Tunkett today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; the girl replied, as she returned to the
setting of the table for supper. Captain Ezra puffed
on his corncob pipe a moment, then said: &ldquo;I reckon
he&rsquo;ll be over long &rsquo;bout tomorrer. I snum I&rsquo;ll be
glad to see ol&rsquo; Lem. We two&rsquo;s been sort o&rsquo; mates
ever since we was young-uns. Lem, even as a boy,
was straight as the mast o&rsquo; a schooner in all his
doin&rsquo;s.&rdquo; For a few moments the old man smoked
in silent thought. Then aloud: &ldquo;I reckon Lem&rsquo;s
love would be the best port fer my gal to anchor in
if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Instantly the girl&rsquo;s arms were around
his neck. &ldquo;Grand-dad,&rdquo; she implored, &ldquo;don&rsquo; say it.
You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to live&rsquo;s long as I do, an&rsquo; longer, like&rsquo;s
not.&rdquo; Then, as an ominous rumbling of thunder
pealed in the distance, Muriel held him closer.
&ldquo;Grand-dad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked out of the window at the
gathering blackness. Then, loosening her arms, he
leaped to his feet. &ldquo;Rilly gal,&rdquo; he cried, as she still
clung, &ldquo;let me go! The lamp&rsquo;s not turnin&rsquo;. Somethin&rsquo;s
happened to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away he hurried. The girl stood in the little
kitchen where he had left her, with hands hard
clasped. She heard his rapid steps ascending the
spiral stairs. She waited, almost breathless, wondering
why the circle of swinging light did not pass
the window. There must have been a hitch in the
machinery. That, however, was nothing to worry
about. It had happened before.</p>
<p>Then came a vivid flash of fire that zigzagged
across the sky. A torrent of rain swept over the
island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Flash followed flash with scarcely a second between,
and crash on crash of deafening thunder.
Then another sound was heard in the midst of the
reverberating roar, a sound of splintering glass, of
stone hurled upon stone.</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s prophecy had been fulfilled; the storm
had wrecked the lamp that for so many years had
defied it.</p>
<p>With a terrorized cry the girl leaped to the door
of the tower, and, heedless of danger to herself, she
climbed the spiral stairway, shouting wildly that her
call might be heard above the fury of the storm:
&ldquo;Grand-dad, I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; But the rain and wind
beat her back; then the terrible reality surged over
her. The lamp&mdash;the tower, both were gone! They
had been hurled to the ground by the storm. Muriel
knew no more, for she had swooned.</p>
<p>Hours later she was found by Doctor Lem and
several longshoremen who had crossed the tossing
waters of the bay to discover why the light was not
throwing its warning beams out into the darkness.</p>
<p>Carefully, tenderly they lifted her. She had been
bruised by rocks that had fallen while she lay there,
though of this she had not been conscious. Doctor
Lem and two of the men had taken her back to town
and had waited until she had revived; then, leaving
her in the care of the physician&rsquo;s housekeeper, Brazilla
Mullet, the men, in the cold, grey dawn, had
returned to the island to find the keeper of the light,
who had been faithful even unto death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Muriel had been too dazed to really comprehend
what had happened and Doctor Lem thought best to
have the burial service at once and not wait until the
grand-daughter could attend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little gal,&rdquo; Brazilla Mullet wiped her eyes
on one corner of her apron, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s lost her best
friend, I reckon, but she&rsquo;s got a powerfully good one
left in Doctor Lem, though she&rsquo;s little carin&rsquo; jest
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, who had been lying so listlessly in the
spare room bed, opened dazed eyes and gazed a brief
moment at the kind woman, who endeavored to smile
though her lips trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everythin&rsquo;s like to be fer the best,&rdquo; Miss Brazilla
Mullet said. &ldquo;Doctor Lem&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to carry out
yer grand-dad&rsquo;s wishes, Rilly. He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be yer
guardeen now an&rsquo; take yo&rsquo; back wi&rsquo; him to the city
an&rsquo; when yer well agin yer goin&rsquo; to school up thar
to be iddicated wi&rsquo; the best of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the good woman saw that the lips of the
girl were moving, though she was not addressing
her, and, leaning closer, she heard the words:
&ldquo;Grand-dad, I&rsquo;m rememberin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m a-holdin&rsquo; fast to
the promise I made yo&rsquo; like &rsquo;twas my life preserver.
But, oh, Grand-dad, it&rsquo;s so hard to, so hard to, all
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Then for the first time tears came and Muriel
sobbed as though she would never stop, but the
housekeeper was glad, for tears would bring the relief
she needed.</p>
<p>And Brazilla Mullet was right. Muriel gradually
became stronger, and when the doctor&rsquo;s spring vacation
was ended, without once looking over the bay
toward Windy Island, the girl went back with him
to the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV.
<br />HIGH CLIFF SEMINARY.</h2>
<p>The High Cliff Seminary was surely well named,
for from the windows of its grey stone turrets one
had a sweeping view of the surrounding country
with its lovely woodlands, its wide meadow where
grain was yellowing or stacked in the sun, with here
and there a nestling town, a suburb of the big city
that was several miles nearer the sea. Directly beneath
were the sheer cliffs and then the broad, busy
Hudson.</p>
<p>On the sun porch, one Saturday afternoon in September,
a group of girls was gathered. It was evident
that they were all old friends, as indeed they
were since they had attended High Cliff Seminary
the year previous. Among them were Faith Morley,
Gladys Goodsell and Marianne Carnot.</p>
<p>Leaning back in a comfortable cushioned wicker
chair, Marianne looked at the other through partly
closed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your democracy in America is crude, n&rsquo;est-ce
pas?&rdquo; she said, shrugging her shoulders and looking
toward the far end of the long glassed-in veranda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>There, all alone, stood a girl dressed in dark blue
whose red-brown hair was neatly fastened at her
neck. With hands idly clasped in front of her, she
watched the boats plying up and down the great
river, and, oh, the loneliness, the bleak, grey loneliness
in the heart of the girl.</p>
<p>Without a glance at the curious group at the other
end of the sun porch, she soon turned and went
within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I confess democracy is carried rather far
in this particular instance,&rdquo; the plump, good-natured
Gladys Goodsell remarked. &ldquo;Not that I care greatly.
We do not have to associate with her, whoever
she is, unless we so desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anyone know who she is?&rdquo; Catherine
Lambert inquired.</p>
<p>The questioner did not look at the French girl,
nor would she have been able to interpret the meaning
of the slight sneer that appeared on the dark,
handsome face for a fleeting second even if she had
seen it.</p>
<p>Marianne had told no one that she had met Muriel
the year before on Windy Island, and Muriel herself,
though conscious of the presence of Marianne
Carnot, was so numbed with grief that she cared
little that she was being snubbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>The coming of that &ldquo;crude island girl&rdquo; to this
fashionable school had angered Marianne, but the
memory of Gene&rsquo;s very evident preference for Muriel&rsquo;s
companionship had aroused in the heart of the
French girl a desire to make the other suffer, but she
would bide her time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true that she cannot speak the English language
correctly?&rdquo; The tone of the questioner was
horrified in the extreme.</p>
<p>Faith Morley nodded, adding hastily (because her
heart was kind): &ldquo;But that in itself is not vital, for
surely she can learn to speak correctly, but&mdash;but of
course her family is rather impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lighthouse-keeper&rsquo;s grand-daughter!&rdquo; This
from Adelaine Stuart, whose family tree was always
shown to each new pupil at High Cliff, if she
chanced to be one whom Adelaine wished to impress.
That her father was imprisoned for having robbed
widows and orphans with his wildcat schemes she
did not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Faith, you know something of the girl&rsquo;s
story. Why don&rsquo;t you tell it?&rdquo; This from Gladys.</p>
<p>Faith hesitated. Would Helen wish her to tell,
and yet surely there was nothing in what she knew
that ought to be kept secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what I know is not much,&rdquo; Faith confessed.
&ldquo;Muriel Storm is an acquaintance of Gene
Beavers and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exclamations of amazement interrupted the
speaker.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Conscious of the shock and surprise her statement
had caused in the group, Faith hurried on to explain.
&ldquo;You remember Gene had to leave college
last fall because of a collapse of some kind.&rdquo; Several
nodded. &ldquo;Well, he then went to Tunkett, a sea-coast
town, to recuperate, and while there he met the
keeper of the light who was Muriel&rsquo;s grandfather.
They did a good deal, Helen told me, to help Gene
regain his health.&rdquo; This last, rather defiantly.
Faith, unlike the others, was not a snob at heart.</p>
<p>Nor, for that matter, was Gladys. &ldquo;Poor girl,&rdquo;
she now put in. &ldquo;I do feel sorry for her. Anyone
who watches her for five minutes can tell that she has
a broken heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that? What has happened to her?&rdquo; Adelaine
Stuart was curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if any of you recall that terrible electric
storm that we had last June,&rdquo; Faith continued.
&ldquo;I remember how it crashed over New York. Old-timers
said there had not been one as severe in
twenty years. Well, it was during that storm that
the lighthouse was struck by lightning, the old man
was instantly killed and the girl hurled beneath the
debris. She was unconscious hours later when she
was finally rescued. All summer long she has been
in a hospital in the city under the care of some physician
whose home was formerly in that same sea-coast
town. He it is who is sending her here.&rdquo;
They saw that the girl about whom they were talking
left the veranda, apparently without having noticed
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Faith went on: &ldquo;Years ago Doctor Winslow&rsquo;s
sister and our Miss Gordon were friends.&rdquo; Miss
Gordon was the charming middle-aged woman who
presided over High Cliffs. &ldquo;Then this Muriel Storm
not only belongs to a class of fisherfolk, but she is
also a charity pupil.&rdquo; Adelaine Stuart tried to show
by her tone and expression the pride and scorn which
should be exhibited by one possessed of a family
tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall write my mother,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;and
if I am not much mistaken Miss Gordon will consider
it greatly to her advantage to at once dismiss
that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do the same,&rdquo; Phyllis Dexter echoed.
&ldquo;We ought not to be forced to breathe the same air
with&mdash;with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Une bourgeoise,&rdquo; Marianne concluded the sentence
for her.</p>
<p>The others did not notice when Faith Morley
slipped away. She rebuked herself for not having
thought of it before. Surely her dear friend Helen
Beavers would wish her to be kind to the girl whose
grandfather had been kind to Gene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Faith paused outside of a room on the third floor
of High Cliff Seminary and listened. Surely someone
within was sobbing. Again her loving heart
rebuked her. How many, many hours during the
last week that the island girl had been in their midst
had she sobbed like this and no one had come to
comfort her? Muriel was in none of Faith&rsquo;s classes
and so she seldom saw her. Nor did she eat with
the other pupils in the main dining hall, for, temporarily,
she was seated at the right of Miss Gordon
at the teachers&rsquo; table, there being a vacant chair
which soon would be occupied by Miss Humphrey,
the English teacher, whose leave of absence had not
yet expired.</p>
<p>The problem of finding a seat for poor Muriel at
first had been a hard one for Miss Gordon to solve,
for she knew full well how heartless and snobbish
were many of the daughters of her wealthy patrons.</p>
<p>When she received a message from Miss Humphrey
stating that she would not return for another
fortnight, the principal talked the matter over with
the faculty and Muriel was then invited to sit with
the teachers until the absent one should return. This
would give Miss Gordon time to discover if any of
the pupils were kindly disposed toward Muriel, and
if so, she could then be placed at one of the three
long tables in the main dining hall at which the
young ladies were seated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>The teachers&rsquo; table was in a curtained alcove, and
so many of the girls were not even aware of the
fact that Muriel dined there. Moreover, it had been
Doctor Lem&rsquo;s wish that the island girl should receive
private instruction, and as Miss Humphrey
was the only teacher whose time could be arranged
to make this plan possible, Muriel&rsquo;s studies had not
as yet begun.</p>
<p>Every day Miss Gordon sent for the girl to come
to her room at the twilight hour. At first she did
this for the sake of Doctor Lem, whose sister had
been her dear friend, but after a time she did it
gladly, for she found in the soul of this untutored
girl much that it would be a joy to awaken and
develop.</p>
<p>But, of course, there were many hours every day
when Muriel was left alone. Oh, so alone. While
the other girls were at their classes she wandered
about the extensive, parklike grounds that grew wilder
and more beautiful, so Muriel thought, a quarter
of a mile down the Hudson and away from the
school.</p>
<p>There she found a spot on an overhanging ledge
where a young pine tree was clinging, none too
securely, to the bank, for after each storm the earth
beneath it loosened and a day was coming when that
small pine and the ledge on which it stood would be
hurled down the steep cliff into the blue waters
seething far below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>The cliff on which the light had stood the island
girl had thought high, but this was a sheer wall of
rock that rose twice as far from the water toward
the sky. The little pine had grown very dear to
the girl who so loved nature, and often she would
sit on the ledge, her cheek pressed against the rough
bark, her eyes gazing far up the river, seeing not
the boats of all kinds that were plying back and forth,
hearing not the discordant sounds of screeching
tugs or warning whistles, but picturing in memory
the island she so loved and the lighthouse standing
as it had for so many, many years, and tears gathered
in her eyes as, in a dream, she saw her grandfather
again as he had looked on that never-to-be-forgotten
day, and then suddenly she would sob and
hold her arms out, calling, &ldquo;Grand-dad! Grand-dad,
come and get your Rilly gal!&rdquo; On one of these
occasions she had cried herself weary, and for a moment
she had slept on the little overhanging ledge.
Her grand-dad seemed to come to her and say so
plainly that she heard his voice: &ldquo;Fust mate, didn&rsquo;t
you&rsquo;n me agree that we&rsquo;d trust the Skipper at the
helm, knowin&rsquo; His guidin&rsquo; to be for the best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, Grand-dad,&rdquo; she said aloud, sitting up and
looking about. Then she rose and drew back, shuddering,
for she had been very close to the edge of
the overhanging ledge. How easy it would be to
fall off and&mdash;&mdash; The girl turned and ran all the
way back to the school. That had been the day before
and today she was staying indoors, half afraid
to visit the ledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>She sat up and looked toward the door when she
heard a knock. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; she called, leaping to
her feet. Her visitor, she supposed, would be either
Miss Gordon or the maid of that corridor.</p>
<p>When Muriel saw a strange girl in the hall she
felt rebellious, believing that she had called out of
unkind curiosity, but Faith held out her right hand as
she said graciously: &ldquo;Miss Storm, I am Faith Morley,
one of your schoolmates. I am sorry that I
have not been up to see you sooner. Helen Beavers
and Gene are dear friends of mine, as perhaps you
do not know, and I am convinced that they would
wish me to be your friend, too.&rdquo; Then, feeling that
the sentiment could be put in an even more kindly
way, she added impulsively: &ldquo;Truly, I want to be
your friend. May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears gathered slowly in the clear hazel eyes and
the lips that replied quivered: &ldquo;Thanks, but I dunno
why you&rsquo;d be carin&rsquo; for my frien&rsquo;ship. If you do,
though, I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>They sat in chairs near each other, and Faith, looking
for the first time with eyes that really saw Muriel,
decided that she had a most interesting face.
There was far more depth of character expressed
in it than in many of the pretty doll faces of the
pupils at High Cliffs. For one wild second the
visitor groped for a subject of conversation that
would interest this island girl. Of course she might
have gossiped about the other pupils in the school,
but Faith had been taught never to talk of persons,
but rather of things and events. She now recalled
having heard Helen say that Muriel had never been
farther inland than Tunkett, while she, Faith, had
circled the globe with her parents two years before.
Then her eyes fell upon the copy of &ldquo;Treasure
Island,&rdquo; Muriel&rsquo;s gift from Gene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you enjoy that book?&rdquo; the visitor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t read,&rdquo; Muriel replied simply, &ldquo;but I love
the sea an&rsquo; the life on it. Cap&rsquo;n Barney often told
me tales of sea adventure an&rsquo; Gene Beavers read to
me out of this book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith&rsquo;s dark eyes lighted. &ldquo;Oh, Muriel,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;my father gave me such an interesting
book about the sea for my birthday, and I&rsquo;m reading
it now. I&rsquo;d just love to read it aloud to you if you
would enjoy hearing it. Of course it will come in
your reading course, in time. Shall I get the book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was real eagerness in Faith&rsquo;s voice, and
also in her heart, for she yearned to help this girl
who as yet hadn&rsquo;t been given a chance.</p>
<p>Muriel was indeed pleased with the suggestion
and so Faith went at once to her room, returning a
few moments later with a beautifully illustrated
copy of &ldquo;Two Years Before the Mast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel,&rdquo; she announced when she opened the
door, this time without knocking, &ldquo;I wonder if you
know how lucky you are. You have the nicest room
in the school. This round cupola room with so
many windows, and such a sweeping view in three
directions, is the one that many of us hope each year
will be given to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she laughed. &ldquo;Honestly, I do not eavesdrop,
but I happened to be in the reception room the
first day of this term and heard Adelaine Stuart&rsquo;s
mother offering to pay extra if her spoiled darling
could have it. But Miss Gordon said it had been
reserved for you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think of that, young lady. Moreover, you are
doubly lucky, for, not only have you the nicest room
in the school, but you are invited to spend an hour
every evening with the idol of all our hearts, the
adorable Miss Gordon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel smiled at her new friend&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t last long, though,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I mean,
Miss Gordon&rsquo;s just bein&rsquo; kind to me now because
she knows as I&rsquo;m lonesome an&rsquo; she&rsquo;n Uncle Lem are
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith looked pityingly at the girl whose shadowed
eyes plainly showed that many hours had been spent
in tears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel,&rdquo; she suggested, &ldquo;suppose you lie on the
window seat. Pile those pillows under your head
and try to rest while I read. I&rsquo;m afraid you are
holding yourself too tense these days, as our gym
teacher tells us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel did as she was bidden and Faith continued:
&ldquo;Now, take a deep breath and drop down
on the pillows with every muscle relaxed. Listen
idly while I read until you fall asleep. I really think
that restful sleep is what you most need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Faith read for an hour. Muriel was greatly
interested, but she was also very weary, and after a
time she did fall into the first restful sleep that she
had had since she arrived at the school.</p>
<p>Faith drew a cover over her new friend and stole
out, but she did not go directly to her own room.
Instead she went to the office of Miss Gordon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV.
<br />MURIEL FINDS A FRIEND.</h2>
<p>Miss Gordon looked up from her desk, at which
she was writing when, at her request, the door of
the office opened. &ldquo;Oh, good afternoon, Faith,
dear,&rdquo; she said when she saw the little brown maid
who stood there, for nut-brown the girl surely was,
hair, eyes and skin being dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you spare a moment?&rdquo; Faith asked, not
wishing to interrupt, for she knew that her mission
could be postponed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you wish. Come in and sit down.
I know by your eager expression that you have
something to ask or to tell. What is it, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Muriel Storm, Miss Gordon, that I
wish to speak. I have been with her for the last two
hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The principal looked her pleasure. &ldquo;Oh, Faith,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad if you are taking an interest
in poor, heart-broken Muriel. There is wonderful
material in that girl and you are the one pupil in the
whole school whom I had thought of asking to befriend
her, but I decided to wait and see if there
were any who would be kind to her without my
having asked it as a favor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I, too, think that Muriel is very unusual,&rdquo; the
girl declared warmly. &ldquo;When I visited her room
today I felt at once that yearning one would feel for
any helpless thing that was hurt, but soon I became
interested in her for herself alone. I never before
saw a face that registers emotion more wonderfully,
as Miss Burns calls it in our drama class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; Miss Gordon replied. &ldquo;I soon
found that Muriel loved nature passionately, and
what do you suppose we have been doing during the
evening hour that we have spent together this week?
Reading and listening to the great nature poems!
And, dear, one night when the girl came to me she
said, almost shyly: &lsquo;Miss Gordon, I <i>heard</i> a little
verse today when I was out with my pine,&rsquo; and then
she told it. Although crudely worded, that little
poem promises much. It described the surf beating
on the rocks of her Windy Island home and of a
lame pelican which is unable to compete with the
more active birds in its struggle for existence, and
depends largely on Muriel for its sustenance. She
had been thinking of this bird friend, it seemed, and
of the nature poems that I had read when this little
verse came to her thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gordon, do you think that this untaught
island girl is really a poet at heart?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think just that. But, dear, Muriel is not untaught.
True it is that she cannot speak our language.
She knows nothing of science or numbers,
but she has been taught high ideals by one of nature&rsquo;s
noblemen, her grandfather. Too, she has
been taught the folk-lore of Ireland by another whom
she calls Captain Barney, and nature, the winds, sky,
storm, birds and sea have taught her much else.
There are few girls at High Cliffs who are as well
grounded in things worth while as is our Muriel
Storm. Now, dear, what is it you wish to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith hesitated, then said: &ldquo;I was thinking that
it might be pleasant for Muriel to sit in the dining
hall with us.&rdquo; Then she added, flushing: &ldquo;Of
course, Miss Gordon, it is pleasant for her to be with
you, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older woman placed a hand upon Faith&rsquo;s as
she said: &ldquo;Dear, I understand, and also I have been
waiting for this to happen. I wanted to place her
where she would be happy and not unkindly treated.
What is your suggestion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering if Phyllis Dexter, who sits between
Gladys Goodsell and me, could not be placed
at the long table with her friend Adelaine Stuart.
Every day she wishes that she were there, and then
Muriel could sit next to me. Gladys will be very
kind to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>There was a glad light in the eyes of the principal.
She touched a button twice in rapid succession and
the head waitress soon appeared. The change was
ordered and then when the maid had departed Miss
Gordon arose. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in fifteen minutes
the supper bell will ring. Will you take Muriel with
you to the dining hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Miss Gordon! I am so glad that
I have had this talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Muriel was just waking from her siesta on the
window seat, feeling wonderfully refreshed, when
she heard the bell which meant that she had but
fifteen minutes in which to prepare for the evening
meal.</p>
<p>Again there came a tap on her door and this time
Muriel called eagerly, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; She was sure
that it would be Faith, and impulsively she whirled
about, saying: &ldquo;Will you be forgivin&rsquo; me for fallin&rsquo;
asleep when you was readin&rsquo; to me?&rdquo; Faith
caught the outstretched hands as she replied: &ldquo;Yes,
Muriel, if you will grant me a great privilege.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The island girl did not know that word, and, as
usual, her face registered her perplexity. Faith
laughed. Then, more seriously:	&ldquo;Dear,	I would
not hurt your feelings for worlds, but I was wondering
if you would like me to help you to speak as we
do?&rdquo; She looked anxiously into the clear hazel eyes
and to her joy she saw a glad light dawning there.
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d be thankful if you&rsquo;d care that much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll begin on the sentence you said
a moment ago.&rdquo; Muriel slowly repeated it correctly
after Faith. Then she exclaimed happily: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a rift in the clouds for me an&rsquo; the sun&rsquo;s a-gleamin&rsquo;
through.&rdquo; There were sudden tears, but also a
shining smile as she added: &ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be a long
while before I can get the speakin&rsquo; right, but I&rsquo;ll
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last bell for supper was pealing through the
corridors and Faith, catching the hand of Muriel,
hurried her away.</p>
<p>There were groups of girls in twos and threes
going down the circling stairway, and although many
of them greeted Faith, none even smiled at her companion,
but there were three who swept past with
their heads held high. These snobbish girls were
Marianne Carnot, Adelaine Stuart and Phyllis
Dexter.</p>
<p>But a second later skipping feet were heard back
of them and plump, good-natured Gladys Goodsell
caught Faith by the arm. &ldquo;Belovedest friend,&rdquo; she
said, after nodding at Muriel, &ldquo;where hast thou been
this afternoon? Didst forget that we were to play
tennis at four?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Faith turned, truly contrite. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to confess
that I did forget, Gladys. I am so sorry. Are you
very hurt with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A jolly laugh rang out at this reply. &ldquo;Getting
angry would take more energy than I have to expend.&rdquo;
Then, more seriously: &ldquo;I know my friend
Faith too well to think that she would neglect an
engagement if she recalled it, and, as it happened,
Catherine Lambert was pining to have someone play
singles, and so I made her happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the large, pleasant dining hall
and saw many girls who were already there standing
behind their chairs. Purposely, Faith delayed
her companion near a window overlooking the garden
of asters. The island girl&rsquo;s eyes were aglow as
she looked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty they are,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the like of &rsquo;em
I&rsquo;ve not seen. We had the wild ones but no planted
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladys, who did not in the least understand what
was happening, glanced over at Faith, who, in a
moment when she could not be observed by Muriel,
placed her finger on her lips and nodded, as much as
to say, &ldquo;Do as I do and I&rsquo;ll explain later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladys had chummed with Faith and Helen
Beavers during the three years they had been at
High Cliffs and understood the sign language of
her friend almost as well as she did the spoken
word. So she knew that something unexpected was
about to happen, and that she was to take her cue
from Faith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Although Muriel occupied the seat formerly that
of Phyllis Dexter, the change had not pleased that
proud girl, who had so wished to be placed next to
her particular friend, Adelaine Stuart. Instead she
found herself placed between two seniors in whom
she was not remotely interested. The truth of the
matter was that Miss Gordon had long been observing
the three girls, Marianne, Phyllis and Adelaine,
and thought it wise to keep them apart whenever
it was possible.</p>
<p>When Muriel, looking almost happy for the first
time since her arrival at High Cliffs, was seated, she
felt a compelling gaze and glanced across the room.
There she saw Marianne watching her through half-closed
lids. There seemed to be in the French girl&rsquo;s
expression a threat that endangered her new-found
joy and peace. But Faith, who also had seen,
reached under the table and, finding Muriel&rsquo;s hand,
she held it in a close, protecting clasp, and the island
girl knew that come what might she would not have
to stand alone.</p>
<p>Saturday dawned gloriously bright, for it was
Indian summer on the Hudson. The air was soft
and balmy, the sunshine hazy and a dreamy little
breeze rustled the few yellowing leaves that were
still clinging to the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just the day for a hike,&rdquo; Faith announced at
breakfast.</p>
<p>Catherine Lambert, who sat across the table,
looked up eagerly and in answer to the speaker&rsquo;s
question, &ldquo;Who wants to go?&rdquo; she at once replied,
&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel is to be the guest of honor.&rdquo; Faith smiled
lovingly at the girl next to her. &ldquo;Gladys, how about
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were to practice for the tennis
tournament today. There is only a month left, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. So we were. But, Gladys, if you
will go hiking with us today I&rsquo;ll promise to practice
tennis every afternoon next week from four to five,
my free time, on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her friend looked at her inquiringly. &ldquo;Name it,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fifteen minutes each day may be devoted to
teaching Muriel our favorite game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed. Who knows but that she may be just
the champion player for whom we are looking,&rdquo;
Gladys good naturedly declared with sincere fervor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>And Catherine chimed in with: &ldquo;Oh, wouldn&rsquo;t
it be great if we could make a player out of Muriel?
We haven&rsquo;t anyone on our side as light on her feet
or as quick as Marianne Carnot. Just because of
that I&rsquo;ve actually been afraid that we might lose out
on the great day.&rdquo; Then, to the wide-eyed listener,
Faith explained: &ldquo;On Thanksgiving every year we
have a tennis tournament. Marianne and her
friends are the opponents of Gladys and her chums.
Of course, naturally we are eager to win. Now,
Muriel, if you are willing, we will train you. Not
that we expect you really to bring victory to our
side; that would be asking too much, since Marianne
Carnot was the champion tennis player in the English
boarding school that she attended before she
came to America. She has three medals to prove her
frequently made boast, and, moreover, we have seen
her play.&rdquo; Then, as the surveillant of the dining
hall gave the signal, the pupils rose and left.</p>
<p>In the lower corridor, near the office of the principal,
Faith paused. &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; she said
softly. &ldquo;I am going to ask Miss Gordon if we may
take our lunch. I do not have to return to the school
until three o&rsquo;clock, just in time for my violin
lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The permission was readily granted and then the
four girls went to their rooms to dress for the hike.</p>
<p>Muriel was happier than she had supposed she
would be ever again, and she actually smiled at her
reflection as she donned her sport skirt, sweater and
tam.</p>
<p>When she was dressed, Muriel stood gazing idly
from her window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI.
<br />MURIEL RECEIVES A LETTER.</h2>
<p>When Muriel Storm returned from the hike to
the woodlands and found upon her desk a letter from
Gene Beavers she did indeed rejoice, and without
stopping to remove her hiking apparel, she curled
up on her window seat to read the missive, which, as
usual, was couched in the simplest words.</p>
<p>The two weeks of tutoring which Muriel had received
from Faith had helped her to read with far
greater ease. The lad told of his long illness which
had resulted from the cold, stormy weather, the
rough voyage and the damp, foggy climate of
London.</p>
<p>He had seen nothing of the city since his arrival,
but even though they were living in one of the
fashionable outlying districts, he could hear the distant
roar of the traffic, and now he yearned to be
back on Windy Island, where only were to be heard
the sounds of nature.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>When Gene wrote that letter he knew nothing
of the tragedy of the lighthouse, for although Faith
had mentioned it in a letter to Helen, his sister had
thought best not to sadden him with news that might
be a shock to him, for she well knew how greatly he
admired the old man who had been keeper of the
light.</p>
<p>However, she had been glad to tell him that
Muriel Storm was attending the High Cliff Seminary.
This did not really surprise him, for often
he had heard Doctor Winslow say that, as soon as
he could convert the old sea captain to his point of
view, he, at his own expense, intended sending the
girl, of whom he was fond, to some good boarding
school.</p>
<p>Little did Muriel dream that Gene&rsquo;s proud mother
had sent for him that she might get him away from
the degrading influence of the fisherfolk with whom
he had been staying and about whom she had heard
from Marianne&rsquo;s father, who was a business friend
of Mr. Beavers.</p>
<p>Then for months she positively forbade the boy to
write to the &ldquo;island girl,&rdquo; but at length, when his
illness lasted so long, the mother consented to permit
Gene to write if he would promise to remain in
England until he was twenty-one. By that time he
would have forgotten that daughter of the common
people, for she, of course, would be unable to travel,
and so they would not meet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>For a long time after the reading of the epistle
Muriel sat with the letter lying in her lap as she
gazed with unseeing eyes at the busy Hudson. If
only she knew how to write! As yet she had never
answered one of Gene&rsquo;s letters, nor had he expected
a reply. Of course, Faith, Gladys or Catherine Lambert,
all dear friends, would gladly pen a letter at
her dictation, but that would not be quite the same.
She wanted to write the very first letter all by herself.</p>
<p>She wondered how long it would be before she
could learn.</p>
<p>It was nearing five o&rsquo;clock when there came a rap-i-tap
upon her door, a signal meaning that Faith
awaited without.</p>
<p>In reply to Rilla&rsquo;s &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; the door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel Storm, I do believe that you have been
day-dreaming again! Why haven&rsquo;t you removed
your hiking togs? I came up to tell you that Miss
Widdemere wishes us to gather in the study hall at
five-fifteen for the first class of the year in politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The island girl sprang up and hastily began to
change her costume. &ldquo;A class in politeness, is it?&rdquo;
she repeated, in a puzzled tone of voice. &ldquo;What
does one have to be learnin&rsquo; in that kind of a class?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Faith sat on the window seat to wait until her
friend was ready to accompany her. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a sort
of society stunt, so to speak,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We
practice curtsies for grace, make seven different
varieties of calls, more or less, are taught what to
do with our hands and feet, how to be a hostess and
how to be a guest. Oh, yes, and what to do and
what not to do if we&rsquo;re ever presented to a queen.&rdquo;
Faith was purposely exaggerating. She really believed
the class in politeness rather unnecessary,
since the young ladies came from homes where they
learned from babyhood all that they would need to
know.</p>
<p>She had forgotten for the moment that Muriel had
not had these same home advantages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to be goin&rsquo; to it,&rdquo; the
island girl said as she turned away from the mirror,
again dressed in her dark blue school uniform. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be that awkward, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t know nothin&rsquo; about
manners.&rdquo; Her voice was so truly distressed and
the expression on her face so tragic that Faith sprang
up from the window seat and, slipping a protecting
arm about her friend, she said: &ldquo;Dear, I&rsquo;ll ask Miss
Widdemere to excuse you today; that is, just let you
watch the others, and then, this evening, I&rsquo;ll come
up to your room and teach you the curtsy. It would
hardly be fair to ask you to begin with the others
when many of them practiced during the whole of
last year.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Faith had suddenly recalled overhearing a conversation
when she was on her way to the cupola
room. Adelaine Stuart and the French girl had been
just ahead of her and she had distinctly heard the
former say: &ldquo;If it is your desire to humiliate that
lighthouse person wait until she has to take the part
of hostess in politeness class. That will show her
up before the whole school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of the sentence Faith had not heard, as
she had passed the two schemers with her head held
high, but when she came to think it over she wondered
why Marianne Carnot wished to harm Rilla,
whom she barely knew.</p>
<p>Faith resolved to stay close to Muriel to protect
her, if she could, from whatever humiliation Adelaine
and Marianne might be planning, and it was
indeed lucky for the island girl that she had so
staunch a friend.</p>
<p>Faith was glad to find that the Mistress of the
Manners Class was still in her office, and thither she
led Muriel.</p>
<p>The young teacher glanced up and bade them
enter. Then Faith asked: &ldquo;Miss Widdemere, have
you met our new pupil, Muriel Storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brightening expression in the kind
grey eyes back of the large, dark-rimmed glasses.
The teacher advanced, her right hand extended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, and I am most pleased to meet you.
A lucky new pupil you are to have the friendship of
our Faith.&rdquo; This with a loving glance at the girl
who stood at Muriel&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am. Thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Miss Widdemere&rsquo;s glance was puzzled, though not
unkindly critical. It was not customary for girls
from the North to say &ldquo;ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; but perhaps this
new pupil was a Southerner. The teacher was even
more perplexed when Faith beckoned to Gladys
Goodsell, who stood near awaiting her friend, and
said: &ldquo;Will you take Muriel to the classroom? I
wish to speak with Miss Widdemere for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the door was closed, in as few words as
possible Faith told the tragic story of Muriel&rsquo;s coming
to High Cliffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has never had an opportunity to learn the
ways of social life, Miss Widdemere,&rdquo; the girl said
earnestly, &ldquo;but when you know her better you will
think her very unusual, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as she was eager to create a favorable impression,
she added: &ldquo;Muriel has beautiful fancies
and our Miss Gordon believes that she is to be a real
poet some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a loyal friend your friends have in you,
Faith? What is your request?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was granted as soon as heard. &ldquo;Muriel may
listen and watch,&rdquo; the teacher declared, &ldquo;but we will
not ask her to take part until you tell me that you
have coached her sufficiently in private.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Then, as the bell in the corridor was announcing
that laggards must make haste, these two went to the
study hall, where the pupils were assembled. Some
were seated on the desk tops, others standing in
groups chatting, but when Miss Widdemere appeared
all arose, and facing her, made deep curtsies. Muriel
alone remained erect, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Marianne, gazing across the room through half-closed
lids, smiled and nudged her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as graceful as a hitching post,&rdquo; Adelaine
replied, loud enough to be heard by several who stood
near.</p>
<p>Muriel felt their gaze and flushed with embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young ladies will now arrange their chairs
in a large semi-circle, the vacant space in the center
to represent a parlor.&rdquo; Miss Widdemere waited
until the confusion was over and the pupils seated
before continuing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will now select a hostess and ten guests to
attend an afternoon tea. Whom do you name as
hostess, Phyllis?&rdquo; She had turned toward that
young girl because she had risen. &ldquo;I name Muriel
Storm,&rdquo; said Phyllis, who had been well coached by
the girls who sat next to her.</p>
<p>Miss Widdemere sent a keen glance in their direction,
and she said, rather coldly: &ldquo;Young ladies,
partly because of Muriel Storm&rsquo;s recent bereavement,
we are not expecting her to share in our imaginary
social functions for a month at least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Marianne Carnot added in an undertone heard
only by those about her, &ldquo;And the other &lsquo;partly&rsquo; is
that she couldn&rsquo;t if we did expect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith eventually was chosen as hostess and Muriel
intently watched every move made by her friend.
How graceful she was and how gracious! A slip
of a Japanese girl, who was the daughter of the chef
of the school, appeared dressed in an attractive native
costume and played the part of maid for this
class. When she was older she, too, would be trained
for the sphere that she was to fill.</p>
<p>That evening Faith found her friend both discouraged
and homesick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of place I am among you all,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ruther be back with my seagulls, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;.
I&rsquo;ll never take to bowin&rsquo; and goin&rsquo; to teas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith laughed merrily; then shaking a finger at
Rilla, prophesied: &ldquo;The day is coming when you
may be asked to be hostess for a lord or an earl or
someone like that; then won&rsquo;t you be glad that you
learned how at High Cliff Seminary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea was so absurd that even Muriel laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me hostess at an earl&rsquo;s tea party? You&rsquo;re allays
sayin&rsquo; you have no imagination, but I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;
you have some and to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughter brought a better humor, as it always
does, and for an hour that evening Muriel permitted
her friend to teach her the first positions to be made
in the curtsy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII.
<br />MURIEL BEGINS HER STUDIES.</h2>
<p>A fortnight passed and during that time Miss
Gordon and Faith had started Muriel&rsquo;s development
in several directions. In fact, the younger of her
teachers soon triumphantly announced that not a
pupil at High Cliff Seminary could make a more
graceful curtsy than Muriel.</p>
<p>The day before the expected arrival of Miss Humphrey,
who was to tutor the island girl, she confided
to Faith that she just knew that she could make far
greater headway with writing and reading if she
might continue practicing them with her best friend
than she could with a teacher, however learned, who
was strange to her. It was evident to the three girls
who were her closest comrades that Muriel dreaded
the first hour that she was to spend with Miss
Humphrey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>As usual, the island girl seemed almost to foreknow
what was going to happen, and when the moment
arrived Muriel retreated within herself so
entirely that, at the close of a very trying hour, Miss
Humphrey went down to the office of Miss Gordon
and remarked: &ldquo;I must confess that I am extremely
disappointed in your prodigy. Her English is deplorable.
To correct it will take indefinite patience
and far more time than I can spare from my legitimate
classwork. Is there not some one who could
undertake her instruction during the fall term in the
fundamentals?&rdquo; If Miss Gordon was discouraged
her voice did not betray it, when, after a thoughtful
moment, she replied: &ldquo;I am sorry that I asked you
to undertake the tutoring of the island girl. I hoped
that you would see in her the possibilities of an unusual
nature that I still contend are there, but it
will, as you say, require infinite patience to develop
them. Perhaps I had better make some other arrangement,
at least until Muriel has caught up with
your Junior English class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was real relief pictured on the face that was
lined before its time. Rising, Miss Humphrey said:
&ldquo;I am indeed glad that we are agreed on this matter
and if Muriel Storm is advanced enough at the midwinter
term to enter the junior class I will do all
that I can to aid her, but this dialect which she now
speaks must be overcome, and that means tireless
prompting on the part of some constant companion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Miss Gordon also arose and said, not unkindly:
&ldquo;Give Doctor Winslow&rsquo;s protege no more thought
until the midwinter term begins.&rdquo; Then the principal
added, with a brightened smile: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prophesy
that Muriel will then be prepared to enter your
sophomore class and not your junior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Miss Humphrey declared with conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonders never cease!&rdquo; laughed Miss Gordon,
who now wished to end the interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who will tutor Muriel Storm that she is to
make such phenomenal progress?&rdquo; With her hand
on the knob of the open door Miss Humphrey
awaited the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; Miss Gordon replied.</p>
<p>Joy was in the heart of the island girl when she
heard this wonderful news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m that glad, Miss Gordon,&rdquo; she exclaimed
the following evening when, just after dinner, she
was summoned to the attractive little apartment in
a remote wing of the school to which the principal
retired when the tasks of the day were over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>The larger of the two rooms was a library and
study in which there was a wide fireplace, and on
either side long, vine-hung windows that overlooked
the Hudson. Low shelves circled the walls
and they were filled with book-friends, actually read
and loved by their owner. Here and there were
soft-toned copies of famous paintings and a few
charming originals in water color. Too, there were
ferns growing in the wicker window-boxes and a
blossoming plant on a low wicker stand. The comfortable,
inviting chairs of the same weave were
cushioned with soft hues and a shade on the reading
lamp harmonized. The little room just beyond, in
which Miss Gordon slept, had disappearing windows
on all sides, and at night, when these were opened,
only the screens sheltered her from the out-of-doors
she so loved. As the principal had prophesied, Muriel,
in this congenial atmosphere, blossomed not only
rapidly but also beautifully. No one but Faith
guessed how her friend was advancing and she did
not have to guess. She knew.</p>
<p>Miss Gordon had sent for Faith on the very day
that Miss Humphrey had visited the office, and together
they had divided the work and the joy of
assisting Muriel.</p>
<p>In the beginning the principal had merely planned
asking Faith&rsquo;s advice; it had not been her desire to
burden the girl, but at once Faith had said: &ldquo;Oh,
Miss Gordon, I have not told you that for the past
two weeks I have been instructing Muriel in penmanship
and also in reading and spelling. It is a great
pleasure to me to aid her, and if you are willing I
shall continue our little class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The principal&rsquo;s sweet face brightened. &ldquo;Thank
you, Faith. If you will tutor Muriel in the fundamentals,
I will gladly instruct her in the higher
branches.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Then she added, and there was a twinkle in the
sweet grey-blue eyes: &ldquo;Miss Humphrey would
never be able to understand it, but I actually enjoy
reading poetry to that island girl. She sits on a low
stool at my feet and with those liquid hazel eyes
she drinks into her very soul the beauty of the
thought and the music of the rhythm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gordon,&rdquo; Faith said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let us tell anyone
of Muriel&rsquo;s progress. Let&rsquo;s keep it a secret
until the midwinter term. I would like to surprise
Miss Humphrey&mdash;and&mdash;and others.&rdquo; Faith was
thinking of Marianne, whom she knew wished to
humiliate Muriel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><br />CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br />A LESSON IN TENNIS.</h2>
<p>Faith and Muriel were studying together the next
morning, which chanced to be Saturday, when they
heard a hurrying of feet in the corridor and then a
merry banging on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Muriel called. The door was flung
open and in bounced Gladys Goodsell and Catherine
Lambert, wearing tennis shoes and carrying their
racquets and balls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Top o&rsquo; the morning to you,&rdquo; Gladys sang out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coast is clear!&rdquo; Catherine announced almost
at the same time.</p>
<p>The two, who were seated at a small table strewn
with papers and books, looked up inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What coast and how clear?&rdquo; Faith inquired.</p>
<p>Gladys threw herself down upon the window seat
while Catherine perched on the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marianne Carnot and Adelaine Stuart have gone
to the city for the day. Think of that! They left
on the mail boat at nine o&rsquo;clock sharp, chaperoned
by Miss Widdemere, and are to return at six-thirty
P. M. Were we ever in greater luck?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Still the listeners were puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith Morley, put on your thinking bonnet!
Don&rsquo;t you know that we have been just pining to
have an opportunity to instruct Muriel in the beginnings
of tennis without being spied upon by our
arch-enemy, whatever that may mean. Anyway, it
sounds much grander than just enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; Faith replied, &ldquo;but this morning
Muriel and I were planning to study. Can&rsquo;t we play
this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith had not told the others that in reality she
was trying to instruct the island girl in spelling the
simplest words, but Muriel was quite willing that
these two dear friends might know, and so she said:
&ldquo;Teacher Faith, I think I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; a notion of what
you mean about the lesson, and if you&rsquo;d like to be
teachin&rsquo; me tennis, I&rsquo;d love to be learnin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Faith said as she arose, glad indeed
to join in the outdoor game they all so enjoyed.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a thing to do until my violin lesson at
three o&rsquo;clock, although I think I had better practice
for an hour before Herr Professor arrives on the
scene today. Last Saturday he said, &lsquo;Mees Morley,
the practice is less of late, why for?&rsquo;&rdquo; Then she
added: &ldquo;Into your sport skirt, Muriel, and if you
haven&rsquo;t tennis shoes I&rsquo;ll loan you a pair. Fare-thee-well.
I&rsquo;ll be back in a twinkling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Faith skipped away to her room to change her
dress. Catherine and Gladys announced that they
would go ahead to the court and practice until the
others joined them.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Faith reappeared, holding a
pair of tennis shoes. She found Muriel studying
the primer. Rilla looked up with laughter in her
hazel eyes. &ldquo;D-e-a-r,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
beginning of a letter. I wonder how long &rsquo;twill be
before I can be writin&rsquo; one that a person could be
readin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was putting a burnt orange tam atop of her
red-brown hair as she spoke, and then she slipped on
a sweater of the same becoming hue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you so eager to write to, anyway?&rdquo;
Faith was curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s several friends I have that I&rsquo;d like to be
writin&rsquo; to,&rdquo; Muriel began; then, chancing to glance
at the chart made for her by Faith to aid in correcting
the mistakes she so frequently made, she repeated,
very slowly and thoughtfully: &ldquo;I have several
friends to whom I wish to write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; Faith exclaimed, her face glowing
with pleasure. &ldquo;Think ahead of each word
that you say for a few weeks, dear, and soon you will
find that it will be hard for you to speak incorrectly.&rdquo;
Then, slipping her arm within that of her friend,
she added: &ldquo;The champion tennis players will now
descend to the court.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Faith chatted gaily as they went down the wide
stairs, out through the basement door, crossed the
garden, where few flowers were blossoming, as the
nights were frosty, and toward the tennis courts.</p>
<p>Muriel, however, was silent. She was wondering
how long it would be before she could write a
letter to Gene unaided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings!&rdquo; Gladys called as Muriel and Faith
approached. She waved her racket and then, as the
ball, sent with a smash by Catherine, landed in the
court just back of her, she whirled with a sudden
swift movement, caught it on the first bound and
sent it flying back over the net. The island girl
stared at her in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Gladys, it&rsquo;s like a top you&rsquo;re whirling!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Is it me that&rsquo;s expected to learn
such antics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other three laughed, and Catherine, catching
the ball, walked around the net to join the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t expect you to do such expert playing
as that for this tournament,&rdquo; Faith assured her. &ldquo;In
fact, we do not expect you to take part in any of the
actual contest games until next spring, but you might
as well begin your training. It&rsquo;s jolly good fun, if
nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Muriel sighed audibly and Faith laughed. &ldquo;Rilla,&rdquo;
she said, and the island girl heard her grand-dad&rsquo;s
pet name for her for the first time since she had arrived
at High Cliffs, &ldquo;have you been worrying for
fear we did expect you to play against Marianne
Carnot on that fateful day? Indeed not! Catherine
Lambert is the only pupil in this school who can
even approach Marianne in skill and dexterity. You
know the English are great for outdoor sports of
all kinds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s French Marianne is, I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father is a Frenchman, but he is connected
with English and American shipping interests. It&rsquo;s
a huge concern, I don&rsquo;t know just what, but I have
heard Marianne say that their ships circle the globe.
Because of this, Monsieur Carnot resides in England,
where his daughter attended a school, and she
takes every opportunity to assure us it was really intended
only for the daughters of the lesser nobility,
if you know what or who they may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I plead total ignorance,&rdquo; Gladys declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
glad that I&rsquo;m an American. My dad made every
penny that he possesses, and honestly, too. Grand-dad
happened to own vast farmlands which the City
of New York wished to possess, and for which it
paid a fabulous price, hence the grand-daughter of
a farmer is attending High Cliffs with the daughters
of the lesser nobility, if any happen to be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine Lambert laughed. &ldquo;Well, since we four
are not guilty, let&rsquo;s cease chatting and go to batting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cathy, I believe you are trying to be a poet,&rdquo;
Faith remonstrated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, dear, we&rsquo;d hate to have
our best tennis player take to day-dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that! I simply couldn&rsquo;t write a
poem if my life depended upon it. Now, let&rsquo;s explain
the game. Muriel, here is a racket for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine looked over at Faith, who smilingly
nodded, and said: &ldquo;Keep up the good work, Cathy.
If you leave out any leading points Gladys and I
will supply them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, if I am appointed instructress, I will
proceed to instruct,&rdquo; Catherine said. Then she added
in a tone of mock seriousness: &ldquo;Miss Storm,
before you is a tennis court, the boundaries of which
are outlined in white. A net, you will perceive, is
stretched across the center, and the opponents stand
two on either side. Comprenez vous?&rdquo; Then, noting
the pupil&rsquo;s puzzled expression, she translated:
&ldquo;Do I make it clear?&rdquo; Muriel nodded.</p>
<p>Catherine continued: &ldquo;The first player to serve
the ball is selected and the game begins. Now, the
object of the server is to send the ball over the net
in such a manner that it will be difficult for the opponent
to reach it before it bounds twice. It may
be returned after the first bounce, but not after the
second.&rdquo; Then, turning to the others: &ldquo;Now, shall
we begin? Muriel will learn more by actual practice
than by any amount of explanation. I will take
her for my partner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Catherine, you&rsquo;ll be sorry if you do,&rdquo; Muriel
laughingly protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Faith returned. &ldquo;Catherine
could win the game singly against any two girls in
this school if Marianne were not an opponent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the game began. Gladys served and the ball
fell easily within Muriel&rsquo;s reach, but she stood and
gazed at it. For a fraction of a second Catherine
waited, then realizing that Muriel did not understand
that she was expected to return the ball, she
leaped to the other side and, zip, it went flying
gracefully back over the net. After that it was kept
in the air, one volley shot following another in
quick succession until Faith had the misfortune to
throw it into the net, then they all paused for a
breathing spell.</p>
<p>Muriel shook her head. &ldquo;You might&rsquo;s well give
up the notion of teachin&rsquo; me. Such spinnin&rsquo; around
I never could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith laughed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be discouraged. We all
felt just that way in the beginning. Now, Gladys,
let&rsquo;s sit beneath this juniper tree and let Muriel get
some actual practice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>This they did, and during the next half hour Muriel
did some leaping and running that made the
observers decide that, when she understood the rules
of the game, she would play at least as well as the
majority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The luncheon bell is ringing,&rdquo; Faith sang out at
last. The players stopped and the others, gazing at
Muriel, suddenly realized she was truly beautiful.
Her loosened hair clustered in moist ringlets about
her flushed face, her orange colored tam was jauntily
askew, and her eyes were glowing. &ldquo;That was
great fun,&rdquo; she said, when the garden door was
reached. &ldquo;Thank you all for tryin&rsquo; to teach me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<h2 id="c29"><br />CHAPTER XXIX.
<br />JOY KIERSEY.</h2>
<p>That had been the first of many hours of practice
on the tennis courts. Running races with Shags
and rowing had been the only two outdoor sports
Muriel had known. For that reason, perhaps, she
thoroughly enjoyed tennis, and how her friends did
enjoy watching her.</p>
<p>Every afternoon from four to five o&rsquo;clock they
had the court to themselves, that being the hour
when Marianne Carnot was practicing her vocal lessons
on the other side of the school. These three
friends did not wish Marianne to even suspect that
Muriel was being drilled. Not that they had any
hope of winning the game, which was but a fortnight
away. In fact, it would be unwise to permit so new
a player as Muriel to even take part, they decided.
Joy Kiersey, who usually played with Catherine
Lambert, had been ill, and was not yet strong
enough to practice, although she assured the girls
that she would not fail them on the day of the tournament.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have a strong team,&rdquo; Faith told Muriel one
noon at lunch, &ldquo;when Joy is with us, but not so
strong when she isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t met Joy Kiersey as yet, have I?&rdquo; Rilla
said this slowly, thoughtfully, and hence more correctly.</p>
<p>Faith was pleased, but made no comment. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;Joy did not return at the beginning of
the term, and although she has been in High Cliffs
for a week now, she remains in her room most of
the time. We thought that we would call upon her
this afternoon during the free period, and I planned
asking you to accompany us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel shook her head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. Then
twinkles appeared in her clear hazel eyes. &ldquo;I dunno
how to make a call. We haven&rsquo;t had that yet in
politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith, however, did not smile. &ldquo;This afternoon,
dear, you follow me and do just what I do and then,
at least, you will be as correct a guest as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Gordon said that we might go,&rdquo; Gladys
leaned forward to remark, &ldquo;and Joy is eager to
have a real visit with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had an opportunity since she came
to confer about the game.&rdquo; This from Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;d ruther I didn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Faith looked reproachfully at her friend, then
said softly that no one else might hear: &ldquo;Rilla, you
are forgetting our new rule. Think a sentence before
you say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel flashed a bright smile at the speaker,
thought a moment, then repeated: &ldquo;Perhaps your
friend, Joy Kiersey, would rather that I did not
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so, Rilla.&rdquo; Faith was glad to be able to add
truly: &ldquo;Joy asked especially about you. She was
watching us yesterday as we returned from the court
and she inquired who you were, and what do you
suppose she said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess. Something dreadful, like&rsquo;s not&mdash;I
mean&mdash;I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it! Joy asked who the girl was who
carried herself as though she were a princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel looked blank. &ldquo;Who was she talking
about? If &rsquo;twas me, then she was just makin&rsquo; fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear. Joy wouldn&rsquo;t do that. You don&rsquo;t
realize it, of course, but there are times when you
carry yourself, shall I say proudly? Or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Faith
hesitated, groping for a word, then laughingly confessed,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just how to express it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As though she had a family tree like Adelaine
Stuart,&rdquo; Gladys put in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Muriel laughed; then said earnestly: &ldquo;I come
from a long line of good, honest New England seafaring
folk and I&rsquo;m proud of it. My grand-dad
stood erect, the way I suppose you mean that I do.
Summer folk often spoke of it. I remember one
man visitin&rsquo; the light said grand-dad was like a
Viking. Queer how I remembered that word all this
time. I suppose because I wondered what it meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know all about Vikings,&rdquo; Gladys boasted.
&ldquo;Listen and you shall hear. Between the eighth and
eleventh centuries the coasts of the British Isles
were visited by the Norsemen, called Vikings, or
sea-rovers, who contributed much to the romantic
history of medieval Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! What a lot we know,&rdquo; Catherine Lambert
teased as she beamed across the table, and Gladys
merrily retorted: &ldquo;Well, why shouldn&rsquo;t I know it
today, since I only learned it yesterday. But don&rsquo;t
ask me anything about it next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as the signal was given, the girls arose and
left the dining hall.</p>
<p>Little did Muriel guess that these dear friends
had planned the call upon Joy that she might have
an actual experience that would fit her for the
dreaded class in politeness.</p>
<p>The afternoon tea was a delightful affair. Joy,
who seemed to Muriel to be the embodiment of loveliness,
welcomed them to her sunny, flower-filled
room with a graciousness which at once won the
heart of the island girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Joy Kiersey, may I present my friend Miss
Muriel Storm?&rdquo; was the form of introduction
chosen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am indeed glad to make the acquaintance of so
dear a friend of our Faith,&rdquo; was the sincere response
as Joy extended her hand and clasped that of the
new member of their little clan. &ldquo;Now, everybody
find a place to curl up somewhere and let&rsquo;s chat for
half an hour while the kettle boils. Dear Miss Gordon
granted a special dispensation today and yonder
on the tea table is seen the flame of my alcohol lamp
that will soon persuade the tiny teakettle to start its
song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what an adorable teakettle that is! I love
copper things, don&rsquo;t you, Muriel?&rdquo; Gladys exclaimed,
forgetting for the moment that the island girl might
not be familiar with things antique. Faith replied
for her friend, then added: &ldquo;Joy&rsquo;s latest hobby, it
is quite evident, is collecting baskets. You have a
dozen new ones, I do believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their hostess nodded, and pointing to a large,
round and nearly flat basket lying near the hearth:
&ldquo;I found that in Nevada last summer when we were
visiting Lake Tahoe. It was made by the Washoe
Indians and I think that I prize it most of all, and
yet that Washoe water bottle on the mantel is interesting
as a curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>After the bottle-shaped basket had been admired
Gladys asked: &ldquo;Did you find people different in the
West?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the real Westerner,&rdquo; Joy replied, &ldquo;but there
was one thing that was always like a discord to me,
and that was the manner of introduction used by
many of them. They say, &lsquo;Meet my friend.&rsquo; It is
so harsh and so abrupt. If they would say, &lsquo;I would
like you to meet my friend,&rsquo; it would seem more
gracious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel, listening, resolved that she would never
use that crude form of introduction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; Catherine Lambert said softly. &ldquo;I hear
a voice calling to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy uncurled from the big chair which the girls
had insisted that she occupy. &ldquo;Oh, the little copper
teakettle is singing.&rdquo; Then to Faith, &ldquo;Will you
pour today, Miss Morley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one looked at Muriel, and as she did in all
things as her friends did, the serving of tea and
wafers passed without a mishap.</p>
<p>When the bell in the corridor announced the hour
of five o&rsquo;clock Faith rose. &ldquo;Time to depart,&rdquo; she
said. Then to their hostess, &ldquo;Joy, I am so glad that
you are better. We have had a delightful time at
your tea party and shall hope to see you soon in
Pickle Pantry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>This was the name that Faith jokingly gave the
room that she shared with Gladys, for that maiden
being extremely fond of sweet pickles, always had a
bottle of them stowed away in most unexpected
places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; Joy said remorsefully, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t made
a single plan for the game. However, I&rsquo;ll be at the
court tomorrow at four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Faith and Muriel ascended the stairs toward
the cupola room, whither they were going for a
half-hour review of spelling, the former asked:
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Joy a dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her,&rdquo; Muriel said. Then she asked: &ldquo;Are
you sure she is real?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith turned with puzzled eyes. &ldquo;Real? Do you
mean sincere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The island girl shook her head. &ldquo;No, indeed, I
know she is that! I mean that she looks like the
gold and white fairy folk Uncle Barney used to tell
about&mdash;and they always disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith smiled. &ldquo;Joy is our Dresden China girl,
and, oh, Muriel, how I do hope she will grow strong.
Her mother took her West last year believing the
invigorating air of the Rockies would help her; but
even now she hasn&rsquo;t the strength that we who love
her desire. The world has need of girls like our
Joy,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Joy Kiersey, to the delight of her friends, appeared
at the court next afternoon. Her soft, golden
hair was like an aureole of sunshine about her
head, for when she began to play she tossed her pale
blue tam on a bench, where earlier she had flung her
sweater-coat of the same color.</p>
<p>Joy and Catherine played singles for a while, the
two being the experts of the team. Faith, Gladys
and Muriel sat nearby watching with admiring eyes.</p>
<p>Time after time Joy was able to smash a ball over
the net in such a manner that it fell dead before
Catherine could return it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our only hope,&rdquo; Faith confided to Muriel,
&ldquo;that play of Joy&rsquo;s! It&rsquo;s a trick that her Harvard
brother taught her and, watch as closely as we may,
we cannot acquire it. Her brother, it seems, made
Joy promise that she would not teach it to the other
girls unless it might be in an emergency of some
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Marianne Carnot and Adelaine Stuart are to
play against Joy and Catherine,&rdquo; Muriel said, her
eyes glowing with enthusiasm, &ldquo;they will have to be
wonderful players to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would think so,&rdquo; Gladys chimed in, &ldquo;but you
have never seen Marianne run. She seems to be
everywhere at once. It doesn&rsquo;t matter on what part
of the court we place a ball, there that French girl
is, ready to return it, often with a volley, and her
aim is true. However, Joy does excel in the smash
stroke, and so, if she is strong enough to play, we
may win.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Soon Joy declared that she wanted to rest and
watch while the others played.</p>
<p>Faith buttoned the girl who had been ill into her
blue sweater-coat and then wrapped a soft golden
scarf about her, although Joy declared that she did
not need it. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re warm now,&rdquo; Faith told her,
&ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a decided nip in the air today, and we
must be careful of our champion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Muriel was self-conscious, for she knew
that Joy&rsquo;s sweet blue eyes were watching her, not
critically but with interest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, her attention was attracted by
the falling of the ball on the extreme opposite side
of the court. Of course Catherine would run for it,
Muriel thought, but when she saw that maiden slip,
Muriel ran as though her feet were shod with the
wings of the wind. Over the net the ball went and
Catherine was ready to volley it back when Gladys
returned it.</p>
<p>Joy wanted to shout her delight. How she longed
to sing out: &ldquo;Girls, Marianne may be able to run,
but Muriel flies!&rdquo; But, instead she kept very quiet.
She saw that the island girl was beginning to forget
herself, and she did not wish to say anything that
would cause her self-consciousness to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Soon Joy realized that she had over-estimated her
own strength, for a sense of weariness was creeping
over her. She rose, meaning to tell the girls
that she had better go to her room, but she fell back
on the bench, her face pale. Joy had fainted. Faith,
rebuking herself for having permitted the frail girl
to play at all, was quickly at her side, as were the
others.</p>
<p>Joy soon opened her eyes and found her head resting
on Faith&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I frightened you,&rdquo; she said. Then
with a sigh she concluded: &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll have to
give up trying to play in the tournament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Joy dear. We would far rather
have you regain your strength slowly than win all of
the tennis honors that could come to us,&rdquo; Faith
assured her.</p>
<p>With the assistance of loving arms, Joy returned
to the school and was soon made comfortable in her
padded blue silk kimono. Muriel and Gladys brought
wood and made a fire on the hearth, while Catherine
went kitchenward to fill the copper teakettle with
boiling water.</p>
<p>The next day Joy felt as well as she had before,
but the girls were unanimous in declaring that she
must not play tennis again until spring. Then it was
that Joy made a resolution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c30"><br />CHAPTER XXX.
<br />JOY&rsquo;S SECRET.</h2>
<p>When Joy realized that she would be unable to
play in the tournament, which was the formal closing
of the tennis season at High Cliffs, she resolved
to teach Muriel the trick which her brother had
taught her which would send a ball over the net with
a smash and kill it before it bounced. The island
girl knew the rules of the game, it would seem, and
how light she was on her feet and how swift! If
she could master that trick in one week, there still
might be hope of winning. Muriel was sitting at her
desk studying spelling early the next morning when
there came a tap on her door. She thought it was
the maid of that corridor and called, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
But when she saw the blue and gold apparition
standing in the open doorway she sprang to her feet
and held out both hands. &ldquo;Oh, Joy!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;It is good of you to come to see me. Do you think
you&rsquo;re strong enough to be walkin&rsquo; that far?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>The visitor sank down in the big, comfortably upholstered
wicker chair near the hearth, where a bed
of coals glowed. &ldquo;I feel all right this morning,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but after yesterday&rsquo;s experience I am convinced
that I am not strong enough as yet to play in
the tournament; and, Muriel, if you will promise not
to share the knowledge without my permission, I
will teach you the trick that my brother taught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s hazel eyes were wide. &ldquo;But, Joy,&rdquo; she
ejaculated, &ldquo;why is it me you would be teachin&rsquo;
when Faith, Catherine and Gladys all play so much
better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy smiled as she replied: &ldquo;I have two excellent
reasons. One is that the other girls are busy with
their classes nearly all of each day, while you and I
are not. As yet I have not started the regular work.
And so you and I could go down to the court at an
hour when it would be unoccupied. My other reason
is that you are the only one on our side who can
run as does our rival, Marianne Carnot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel flushed with pleasure. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be that pleased
if I could help win the game,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gladly
try, though I&rsquo;m not expectin&rsquo; to be able to learn the
trick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Try is all that any of us can do in this world, it
would seem,&rdquo; Joy said as she arose. &ldquo;I see that
you are studying, and I, too, must get at my French.
Madame Van de Heuton is helping me keep up with
the class, as Mother plans a visit to the continent
next summer if I am strong enough.&rdquo; Joy hesitated,
then continued: &ldquo;Muriel, would you like to study
French with me? The review from the very beginning
would do me just worlds of good.&rdquo; There were
sudden tears in the eyes of the island girl. &ldquo;How
kind you all are to be helpin&rsquo; me,&rdquo; she said, adding:
&ldquo;If you think I&rsquo;ll be needin&rsquo; the French, I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you will need it, some time.&rdquo; Then Joy
suggested that they go to the court at two, when
every other pupil would be occupied indoors. Muriel
said that she would. At the door Joy turned,
and lifting a finger, slender as a fairy-wand, she
whispered, &ldquo;Mums the word! Don&rsquo;t even tell Faith,
will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luckily the court was hidden from the school by
a group of evergreen trees and so no one observed
the two conspirators that afternoon. Patiently Joy
explained the play, and Muriel, who was used to
quick thought and action in her sailboat, was an apt
pupil.</p>
<p>At the end of the first half hour Joy declared that
practice was all that the island girl needed to perfect
her in the smash stroke. &ldquo;Meet me every day at this
hour,&rdquo; her instructress said, as they returned to the
school by a roundabout path, keeping their rackets
well hidden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>With each succeeding day Joy&rsquo;s pleasure in her
pupil increased. She did not have to expend much
energy herself, as when the ball fell dead she merely
picked it up and tossed it over the net. At first Muriel
succeeded only once in a while, but on the fifth
day she never failed.</p>
<p>And yet, at the practice hour with the other girls,
not once did Rilla betray the fact that she knew the
smash stroke. Joy wanted to surprise them on the
day of the tournament.</p>
<p>Faith, Gladys and Catherine wondered why Joy
seemed to be so excited about the coming game,
indeed almost jubilant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<h2 id="c31"><br />CHAPTER XXXI.
<br />THE TENNIS GAME.</h2>
<p>A glorious autumn day dawned, and great was
the excitement at High Cliffs, for many interesting
events were to take place before the setting of the
sun, foremost among them being the contest for the
tennis championship.</p>
<p>Joy had told the three with whom she had expected
to play that she wished they would continue their
plans and permit Muriel to take her place.</p>
<p>Catherine Lambert had stared in amazement.
&ldquo;Joy,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t think that Muriel
Storm can play well enough to enter the tournament,
do you?&rdquo; Then added: &ldquo;Not but that I would be
glad indeed to play with Muriel, but since she has
had scarcely a month&rsquo;s practice I merely thought her
hardly well enough prepared; and, of course, we
don&rsquo;t want to fail so completely that we will be
laughed at by the entire school.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Joy, for one impulsive moment, was inclined to
tell Cathy the whole truth, but her better judgment
prevailed, for she thought it very possible that Muriel
might become self-conscious when she found
herself playing before so many spectators and perhaps
forget the trick she had so recently learned.
After all it would be better not to praise the island
girl&rsquo;s playing too much, for she might fail.</p>
<p>Joy stood looking out of her open window at the
blue Hudson for a long, thoughtful moment before
she inquired: &ldquo;With whom are you planning to
play, Catherine?&rdquo; Her voice showed no trace of
the disappointment that she truly felt because Muriel
was not to be chosen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane Wiggins plays very well, indeed,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;I watched her for half an hour yesterday
while she was practicing on the court. She doesn&rsquo;t
really belong to either side, although she said that
Marianne Carnot had asked her to substitute. She
is to sit on a bench nearby and be ready to run into
the game if one of the players slips or wrenches her
ankle or anything of that sort. When I spoke to
Jane she said that she had not really promised Marianne
that she would substitute, and that she would
much rather play in the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joy smiled. &ldquo;Oh, course, Cathy dear, you girls
are to do the playing, I am not; and you must select
whoever you wish, but I had hoped that you would
want Muriel to play with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we place Muriel on the bench to substitute
for us. Of course, any player is likely to slip
and be out of the game,&rdquo; Gladys suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>This was agreed upon and to Joy fell the task of
telling Muriel that she had not been chosen. When
the others had gone, Joy went to the cupalo room
and knocked. Muriel, she found, was already dressed
in the short skirt and bloomers which the girls of
High Cliffs were permitted to wear for their outdoor
sports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Joy? What have you to tell me?&rdquo;
Rilla asked, for one glance at the lovely face of their
Dresden China girl assured her that something was
wrong. It was with a sigh of relief that she heard
what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m that pleased,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I do hope
you&rsquo;re not mindin&rsquo;, but I most couldn&rsquo;t sleep last
night with worryin&rsquo; about the games. I was so
afraid that our side would lose, and if it did I knew
that it would be my fault. Yesterday I happened to
be out by the courts and saw Marianne Carnot and
Adelaine Stuart practicin&rsquo;, and such playin&rsquo; as they
can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, peering into the troubled blue eyes of her
friend in the same coaxing way that she had often
peered under the shaggy grey brows of her grand-dad,
she said: &ldquo;Please forgive me, Joy, for bein&rsquo;
glad about it, since you&rsquo;ve tried so hard to teach me
the stroke, an&rsquo; if you&rsquo;re wishin&rsquo; it, I will sit on the
bench and be substitute, but I haven&rsquo;t much hope of
our side winnin&rsquo; since I saw those two play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>With this arrangement Joy had to be content and
she went back to her room to dress, not as one of
the players, but in her warm all-over coat, since she
was just to stand around and watch, for the air was
invigoratingly cold.</p>
<p>Although the bloomer suits worn by the players
all were a light tan, their tams and sweater-coats
were of various colors. Many eyes followed the
dark, handsome French girl whose chosen hue was
that of a cherry. She knew that it was most becoming
to her, but since there were no lads about to
impress, she cared little what manner of appearance
she might be making. However, she did want to
win the game by fair means or foul since her opponents
were the girls who had befriended Muriel
Storm, the one person in the whole world whom she
wished to humiliate.</p>
<p>Marianne lifted her finely arched black eyebrows
ever so slightly as she glanced across the net to the
spot near the evergreens where the five opponents
were gathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they chosen Muriel Storm for substitute?&rdquo;
she inquired, her voice expressing her mingled surprise
and amazement. &ldquo;They must be courting defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But how can she play at all?&rdquo; This from Adelaine
Stuart. &ldquo;I have never seen her practicing on
these courts and surely before she came she had no
opportunity to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marianne shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Let us rejoice
that they have chosen her, although, of course,
they may not need a substitute; but if they do, it will
mean an easy victory for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More honor, though, if we had good players to
defeat, I should think,&rdquo; Phyllis Dexter ventured.</p>
<p>But there was no time for further conversation as
Miss Widdemere, who was to keep score, had arrived
and was calling the names of the first four
who were to take their places and select the server.</p>
<p>Five games were to be played and the side winning
three out of five would be proclaimed champion.</p>
<p>Although Jane Wiggin was a fairly good player,
she had not practiced with Catherine and was greatly
handicapped thereby and the opponents easily won
the first game. Marianne scarcely noticed when her
few admirers among the watchers clapped and shouted.
The victory had been too easy to be flattering,
she thought.</p>
<p>The next game was played by Gladys and Faith
on one side and by two of Marianne&rsquo;s friends on the
other and there was far more enthusiasm among the
spectators when Catherine&rsquo;s side won a victory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>Jane Wiggin, knowing that it was her poor teamwork
that had lost the first game, sincerely wished
that she had not agreed to play at all; but it was too
late to withdraw. Though she did her best and
though it was a hard-fought game, Catherine&rsquo;s side
lost. The score stood two games for Marianne and
one for Catherine.</p>
<p>Joy made her way among the onlookers and sat
on the substitute&rsquo;s bench next to Muriel. &ldquo;Oh, if
only I had my bloomers on,&rdquo; she said in a low voice.
&ldquo;I would take Jane&rsquo;s place even if I had to stay in
bed for a week. But in these long skirts I just
couldn&rsquo;t run, so there is no use trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, she glanced at the face of her friend
and saw that she was intently watching every play
being made by Gladys and Faith, who, as before,
upheld the honor of their side and again won.</p>
<p>Two games for each side; but, of course, since
Jane was to play in the fifth, Catherine&rsquo;s group had
no hope of final victory.</p>
<p>Jane knew this as well as did the others and she
was so nervous when she took her place on the court
that she could barely hold her racket. It was her
turn to serve and she batted so blindly that the ball
fell far afield. Then, to the surprise of the onlookers,
she burst into tears and ran from the court and
toward the school as fast as she could go. For a
moment Catherine was panic-stricken; but what was
happening?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Muriel had leaped to the court that had been so
unexpectedly deserted by Jane and had served the
ball without observing the sarcastic smile of her
French opponent. Marianne returned the serve with
a volley, expecting to see the island girl miss; but,
instead, the ball was returned with that smash stroke
which had made Joy&rsquo;s playing famous. Marianne
did her swiftest running but before she reached the
spot the ball had fallen dead and did not bounce.</p>
<p>Amazed, the French girl&rsquo;s brows contracted and,
for the next few moments, she did her very best
playing; but time after time Muriel smashed the ball
over the net. If Marianne was close, then the ball
fell back of her; if she was on the outer edge of the
court, then the ball just cleared the net.</p>
<p>The spectators crowded near. There was a
breathless interest. What could it mean? No one
at High Cliffs knew the stroke except Joy Kiersey.
Suddenly a light dawned upon Faith. Joy had
taught Muriel her trick stroke and that was why she
had been so disappointed when Jane Wiggin had
been asked to play.</p>
<p>A shout arose from the onlookers and there was
a sudden rush toward the island girl and everyone
was congratulating her.</p>
<p>Muriel had won the game, and once more Marianne
had been defeated by &ldquo;une burgeoise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h2 id="c32"><br />CHAPTER XXXII.
<br />WAINWATER CASTLE.</h2>
<p>On the day that Muriel was winning the tennis
tournament, Gene Beavers sat in the library of their
home on the outskirts of London, thinking &ldquo;Oh, to
be near the Hudson now that Indian summer is
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a glorious morning and the lad was tempted
to go for a longer stroll than usual when his sister
burst in with, &ldquo;Oh, Gene, something wonderful has
happened! You couldn&rsquo;t guess what, not in a thousand
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since I&rsquo;m not an Egyptian mummy, there
isn&rsquo;t much use trying,&rdquo; was the smiling response;
but his thought was, &ldquo;How I wish it were that
Muriel Storm has come to England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother is overjoyed,&rdquo; Helen was saying. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the one thing for which she has been longing and
yearning ever since we came, and perhaps for that
very reason she has wished it into existence. Now
can you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much good at
riddles, Sis,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An invitation!&rdquo; was the triumphant announcement
as Helen brought the hand which had been
back of her to the front and held high a white envelope
which bore a crest.</p>
<p>Gene sank down in a comfortable armchair, the
interest fading from his face. &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;A stupid bore, I would call it. How you
women folk can be so enthusiastic about invitations
to receptions and teas is more than I can understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sister sat on an arm of his chair. &ldquo;But,
Gene,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have often wished that you
might stroll around in those park-like grounds of
the Wainwater estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad again assumed an expression of interest.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll agree to that,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;They are wonderfully
alluring. Several times, when I have been out
for a stroll, I have gone down the Wainwater Road
and have paused at the least-frequented gate in the
high hedge to gaze in among the trees, hoping to
catch a glimpse of a fawn, and yesterday I saw one
drinking from the stream. Such a graceful, beautiful
creature, and it looked up at me, not at all
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that gate,&rdquo; Helen said. &ldquo;I stood there a
moment only yesterday, but what I especially admired
was the picturesque view one gets of the
castle-like home which is at least a quarter of a mile
back from the road, among the great old trees. I
have read about such places, with galleries where
ancestral paintings are hung, and I&rsquo;d just love to see
the inside of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably will never have the opportunity,&rdquo;
her brother began; but he was interrupted with:
&ldquo;Have you already forgotten this wonderful invitation?&rdquo;
Helen again held up the crested envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me to what or by whom you
are invited,&rdquo; the lad replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, all of us, are invited to Wainwater Castle
by the elderly Countess herself, and the invitation
was obtained by Monsieur Carnot.&rdquo; Then, noting
the slight frown, she hurried on to explain: &ldquo;You
know, dear, that the Viscount of Wainwater really
controls the business, the American interest of which
our father represents, but it seems that his honorable
lordship, if that is what he is called, is more interested
in the arts, and leaves the direction of matters
financial to Monsieur Carnot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, noting that Gene had turned away and was
looking rather listlessly out of the window, his sister
added: &ldquo;Brother, dear, doesn&rsquo;t anything interest
you any more? I did so hope that you would be
glad to visit this beautiful estate with mother and
me. Father and Monsieur Carnot will be unable to
attend, and we counted upon you to escort us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>The lad looked up with a sudden brightening
smile. Rising, he slipped an arm about the girl as
he said lovingly: &ldquo;Your brother isn&rsquo;t much of a
social ornament, but he ought to be glad, indeed,
that his mother and sister really want his companionship.&rdquo;
The girl looked pityingly into the pale face
that had been tanned and ruddy with health on that
long ago day when she had visited him on Windy
Island.</p>
<p>Impulsively, she took both his hands. &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;it was wrong of mother to make you leave
America just when you were well again and all because
you were enjoying the friendship of a lighthouse-keeper
and his grand-daughter. Some day I
shall tell mother the truth, which is that you and I
both hate, <i>hate</i>, <span class="sc">HATE</span> all this catering to and aping
after the English nobility.&rdquo; Then, inconsistently,
she added: &ldquo;Nevertheless, I <i>am</i> curious to see the
inside of the Wainwater mansion. However, if an
English nobleman asks me to marry him, I shall
reply that I prefer an American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last was called merrily over her shoulder as
she left her brother, who, though amused, heartily
endorsed her sentiment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Mrs. Beavers, who had been greatly elated by the
invitation which she had received from the Countess
of Wainwater, obtained all the information she believed
they would require. Being Americans, they,
of course, did not know the correct way of addressing
an elderly countess and her middle-aged son,
the viscount. They had a private rehearsal the evening
before the great event, which amused the young
people. &ldquo;Mumsie,&rdquo; Helen said gleefully, &ldquo;this reminds
me of &lsquo;The Birds&rsquo; Christmas Carol,&rsquo; when
those adorable Irish children were drilled in manners
before attending a dinner party. Then to give them
a proper sense of family pride, didn&rsquo;t their mother
say, &lsquo;And don&rsquo;t forget that your father was a policeman&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Beavers did not smile. &ldquo;Helen, dear, it is
very important that we know the proper thing to
do and say on all occasions,&rdquo; was her only reply.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, as they were being driven to
the castle-like Wainwater home, Mrs. Beavers looked
admiringly at Helen and Gene. Any mother, even
a countess, might be proud of them, she assured
herself.</p>
<p>However, being Americans, they did not seem to
be as greatly impressed with the fact that they were
to visit a peer of the realm as this particular mother
might wish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Helen had been just as elated when she was on
the way to see an old historical ruin, and as for Gene
Mrs. Beavers glanced at him apprehensively. He
did not seem to be even thinking of the honor which
had been conferred upon them. Indeed, whenever
his mother beheld that far-away, dreamy expression
in his eyes, she feared that he was thinking of that
&ldquo;dreadful girl, the lighthouse-keeper&rsquo;s grand-daughter,&rdquo;
nor was she wrong. At that moment Gene was
wondering what Muriel might be doing and resolved
to write her upon his return.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that it was a glorious,
golden afternoon in October, the windows of the
castle were darkened and the salon within was brilliantly
lighted and thronged with fashionably dressed
gentry from the countryside and from London when
the arrival of the Beavers was announced. The
elderly countess, as Gene afterwards said, would be
just his ideal of a lovable grandmother if she could
be transplanted to a New England fireplace and
away from so much grandness.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, an amused twinkle in the sweet
gray-blue eyes of the little old lady who, during the
first hour, sat enthroned, not being strong enough to
stand and receive.</p>
<p>Gene was idly watching the colorful scene about
him, feeling weary indeed and almost stifled with
the fragrance of flowers and perfumes, when he
felt rather than saw that the countess was watching
him. Glancing toward her, he found that he had
been right, for she was beckoning to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>Quickly the lad went to her side, and in her kind,
grandmotherly way she said: &ldquo;Dear boy, you look
very tired. Why not go out in the park for a while?
Perhaps you will find there my son. He will be
glad to meet you. Follow the stream to a cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gene thanked the dear little old lady for her suggestion
and after telling his mother and sister his
plan, he went out. He soon forgot the brilliantly
lighted salon in his joy at being alone once again
with nature. He had been ill so long that as he
looked back over the days and months they seemed
to stretch behind him illimitably and grey, except
where they were made golden by his dreams of
Muriel.</p>
<p>Dear, brave, wonderful Muriel! Gene knew now
all that had happened; the death of Captain Ezra,
the lighthouse-keeper, who had been so kind to him,
and about the fashionable boarding school to which
Doctor Lem had sent his protege.</p>
<p>The kindly physician had received a note from
Gene one day stating that since he never heard
from Muriel he would greatly appreciate it if, from
time to time, he would write and tell him of the
island girl.</p>
<p>It had not been hard for the older man to read
between the lines and he had replied at once, telling
all that had happened to Muriel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>But only the pleasant part of the letter from Doctor
Lem was being recalled by the lad as he followed
the fern-tangled banks of a stream that wound its
picturesque way deeper and deeper into the wooded
park. Suddenly Gene paused. Surely he heard the
bird-like notes of a flute. He peered among the
trees, but saw no one. Then, as he advanced, the
music was hushed and he decided that, perhaps, it
had been the song of a hermit thrush. There was a
dense growth of evergreen trees just ahead of him.
They crowded so close to the edge of the water that
the lad paused, thinking that he would better go
back, but, noticing a wet, mossy rock near, he
stepped out upon it, and, to his delight, saw just
beyond the pines the rustic cabin of which the countess
had spoken.</p>
<p>Eager and interested, the lad half ran up the path,
soft with pine needles, and tapped upon the door,
wondering if the cabin were deserted. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo;
a deep voice called.</p>
<p>Gene opened the door and entered a large,
square, rustic room which seemed to be both a
hunting lodge and a den. A man whose face seemed
too young for its crowning of grey was lounging in
a deep, comfortable chair in front of a wide fireplace
on which a log was burning. He wore a
crimson velvet jacket and he was reading. Other
books and magazines were placed on a low table near.
Too, there was a flute, the notes of which Gene had
heard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>The man smiled a welcome. &ldquo;American?&rdquo; he inquired.
Gene said that he was. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; motioning
to a chair beyond the hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost?&rdquo; was the next question. &ldquo;No, sent,&rdquo; the
lad replied, then seated himself and told how he
chanced to be there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lady mother must have thought that you and
I would like to know each other,&rdquo; the man said.
&ldquo;You are the son of our American representative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Eugene Beavers also is the name of my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine man! Then, you&rsquo;ve been ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long time. Breakdown in college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over-study or over-athletics?&rdquo; The older man
asked this with a quizzical smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both perhaps. Neglected books while training
for the big game, then broke down cramming for
midwinter exams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think it&rsquo;s beastly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Englishman laughed. &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound
American. What place do you like better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tunkett, Massachusetts.&rdquo; Then it was the turn
of the lad to laugh. &ldquo;That place, of course, means
nothing to you. It isn&rsquo;t even on the map. Just a
fishing hamlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The viscount leaned forward and with the iron
tongs moved the position of the log that it might
burn faster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>His next remark astonished the lad, who thought
he never had met a man he liked better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over here, Gene Beavers, and spend a week
with me; or, better still, we might take a hiking trip
through Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest Injun?&rdquo; The lad&rsquo;s face glowed eagerly,
boyishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest Injun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus was begun a friendship between the Viscount
of Wainwater and Gene Beavers. People marveled
at it, for, though many sought the friendship of the
viscount, few were permitted to enter the seclusion
in which he chose to live.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<h2 id="c33"><br />CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br />THE POETRY CONTEST.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, have you heard that Miss Gordon has
offered a prize for the best poem written by a student
in any of her English literature classes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith nodded. &ldquo;I heard, but I haven&rsquo;t entered. I
can&rsquo;t make two lines rhyme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor could I,&rdquo; Gladys Goodsell said, and laughed
over her shoulder at the newcomer, for she was on
the hearth rug roasting marshmallows over the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who of our clan is going to try for the prize
beside myself?&rdquo; inquired the flushed and excited
Joy Kiersey. &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d be the happiest, you can&rsquo;t
think how happy, if only I could win it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Joy!&rdquo; Gladys changed her position that
she might divide her attention between the fire and
the group of friends. &ldquo;Why are you so eager to
win the prize?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a basket that Joy covets.&rdquo; This merrily
from Faith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>The golden head shook in the negative. &ldquo;I adore
writing poems,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I wrote dozens of
them last summer, but, then, the scenery in Colorado
and along Lake Tahoe would have inspired a stump
to write verse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A month had passed since the tennis tournament
and Joy&rsquo;s strength had returned to her almost miraculously,
and, to the delight of her friends, she was
able to join them in their daily tramps across the
snowy fields and she had even suggested a coasting
party for the first moonlight night.</p>
<p>Too, she had taken her place in the classes and
was going ahead of the others, as she always did
when she was strong enough to really study.</p>
<p>Catherine Lambert looked up from the mysterious
pink thing upon which she was sewing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
Christmas gift,&rdquo; was all that she would tell
about it.</p>
<p>In fact, all were sitting about the rose-shaded lamp
in Muriel&rsquo;s room that stormy Friday night, sewing
upon gifts equally pretty and mysterious. That is,
all except Gladys, their youngest, who said that her
fingers were thumbs when it came to sewing, and
that she would far rather sit on the rug before the
fire and roast marshmallows. One by one she placed
the delicious golden puffs upon a warm plate, and
when there was a goodly heap of them, she arose,
saying: &ldquo;Put away your sewing, girls, and partake
of the refreshments for which I have spent the last
nickle I will have until my Christmas money comes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Gladys,&rdquo; laughed Joy, as she perched upon
the arm of the chair in which Muriel was seated.
The island girl glanced up with a softening light in
her eyes as she felt the caress upon her red-brown
hair. How close these two had grown in the last
month. Not that Muriel&rsquo;s love for Faith had lessened;
in fact, all of these five girls were very dear
to each other, and yet between Joy and Muriel, who
were so unlike, there was growing a love the strength
of which even they hardly knew. Joy, exquisite,
dainty and as jubilant as her name suggested, had
been surrounded from babyhood with every luxury,
while Muriel had known but the bare necessities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose names are entered?&rdquo; Faith asked, as she
put her sewing into a dainty workbag and took one
of the marshmallows.</p>
<p>Joy counted them off on her fingers. &ldquo;Dorothy
Daggert first and foremost, and, since she is a senior
and always wins A-1 in everything that she writes,
there will be little hope for any of the rest of us.
Four others in the senior class have entered, two in
the sophomore, and, girls, what do you think? One
of them is Marianne Carnot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith&rsquo;s expression registered astonishment. &ldquo;You
must be mistaken,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Marianne is in my
class and she never writes verse, even when we may
choose the form for our composition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>Miss Gordon had entered Muriel&rsquo;s name as one
competing and it was because of this fact, as yet
unknown to either Rilla or Joy, that Marianne Carnot
had also entered her name.</p>
<p>Miss Gordon looked up brightly one evening a
fortnight later when she heard a familiar tap on the
door of her little apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Muriel,&rdquo; she said in response to
the greeting from the girl who had entered. &ldquo;I have
some news for you. Can you guess what it is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Gordon, unless,&rdquo; and the hazel eyes
were eager, &ldquo;Uncle Lem is coming for that long-promised
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; the older woman smiled. &ldquo;However,
I have a letter from Doctor Winslow and in it he
assures us both that just as soon as his duties will
permit he shall avail himself of our invitation. The
news has something to do with your school work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel had taken her usual seat, a low rocker on
the side of the fireplace opposite her teacher. Miss
Gordon, looking at the truly beautiful face of the
girl, and at the soft crown of hair that was like
burnished copper in the glow of the firelight, felt
more than ever convinced that Muriel had inherited
much from that unknown father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to be placed in one of the classes?&rdquo; There
was almost dread in the voice that asked the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Miss Gordon laughed. &ldquo;Your expression, dear,
is not complimentary to Miss Humphrey, but, truly,
Muriel, she is wonderfully kind beneath her nervous,
flustery manner, but it isn&rsquo;t that. I am too selfish
to give up teaching you. If you are satisfied with
your present tutor, I assure you I am more than
pleased with my pupil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears sprang to the hazel eyes. The girl leaned
forward, her expressive face telling more than words
could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll study that hard and be as little trouble as I
can if only you&rsquo;ll keep me just this year out, Miss
Gordon.&rdquo; Then she inquired: &ldquo;Now, may I know
the news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about the poetry contest that I was thinking
when you came in. I have been looking over the
poems that have entered and although several are
good, I believe that your verses, &lsquo;To a Lonely Pelican,&rsquo;
are best; but, of course, as you know, dear, I
am not to be the judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is, Miss Gordon?&rdquo; Muriel asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old friend of mine who is Professor of English
in Columbia University. The poems are to be
sent him unsigned and he will decide which reveals
the most talent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>She was looking over a dozen neatly written contributions
to the contest as she spoke. Taking one
from among them, the older woman smiled at the
girl. &ldquo;Muriel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am surprised to see how
prettily Joy Kiersey can write verse. This plaint of
a Washoe Indian maid who yearns for the days
when her wigwam home was beside the lake that
bears her name, and for the young Indian brave
who came to her in a bark canoe across the star-reflecting
waters, shows feeling and is artistically
done. I believe that it will win second place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Gordon,&rdquo; Muriel&rsquo;s voice was eager,
&ldquo;may I withdraw my poem&mdash;if you think it might
win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older woman looked up amazed. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she
said, not understanding this unusual request, &ldquo;may
I know your reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want Joy to win. She loves to write verse
and she said it would please her dad. He thinks it
is wonderful because his daughter is talented. He
is so plain, just a business man without a bit of the
artist in his nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gordon had surmised that a very tender love
was binding these two girls each day closer and
closer and yet she hardly thought it fair to permit
Muriel to make the sacrifice. Joy, she knew, would
not wish it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Marianne Carnot entered a poem yet?&rdquo; the
island girl asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>Miss Gordon&rsquo;s expression was hard to interpret.
&ldquo;No, and I very much doubt her doing so,&rdquo; she had
just said when there came a tap on the door. Muriel
answered the summons. A maid stood there with a
rolled manuscript. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Miss Gordon,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Mam&rsquo;selle Carnot asked me to bring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Miss Gordon looked up from the
finely written contribution. &ldquo;Muriel,&rdquo; she announced,
&ldquo;you will not need to withdraw your poem, for this
is by far the best. It is marked original, and, though
I marvel at it, I may not question the honor of a
pupil of High Cliffs. A week from today we will
know whose poem has been awarded the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<h2 id="c34"><br />CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br />MARIANNE WINS THE PRIZE.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it in the least, and what&rsquo;s
more, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; This from Catherine
Lambert, who sat on a low bench buckling her
skates.</p>
<p>The tennis courts had been flooded and the shining
blue expanse of ice delighted the girls of High Cliffs,
who enjoyed outdoor frolics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Cathy, Miss Gordon herself made the announcement,
and who are we to deny it?&rdquo; Faith
remonstrated. &ldquo;However, as I said before, I never
knew Marianne Carnot to write verse and when one
is a natural poet, one scribbles in rhyme all of the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel and Joy were skating toward the bench,
their faces flushed beneath their jaunty tams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine sport,&rdquo; Rilla declared as they glided
up. &ldquo;At least I can stand now, thanks to the patience
of all of you girls, but I never will be content until
I can do the whirls and figure eights as well as
Catherine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Laughingly Cathy held out her hands. &ldquo;Come,
I&rsquo;ll give you a lesson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gladys detained them, saying: &ldquo;Shall we
tell the girls the bad news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news on a day as sparkling as this?&rdquo; Joy
began. Then, as she glanced from one face to another,
she exclaimed: &ldquo;I know what it is! You
have heard who has won the poetry contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you really?&rdquo; This eagerly from Muriel.
How she did hope that the prize had been awarded
to Joy. But, remembering what Miss Gordon had
said, she almost knew the name that she would hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; Catherine Lambert said emphatically,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just sure that Marianne Carnot is a plagiarist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith put a warmly gloved hand on the arm of
her friend. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very serious accusation,
Cathy. I really do not think that we ought to make
it unless we have more evidence than we have at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine whirled about and her dark eyes
flashed. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d stand by and see your best
friends cheated out of the prize rather than call that
snobbish French girl a thief, which she is, of course,
if she has copied that poem and presented it as her
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have to prove it first, I think,&rdquo; Faith
replied quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>But Catherine, who was not at all meek, retorted:
&ldquo;Well, how are we going to prove it? Of course,
she is too clever to copy one of Tennyson&rsquo;s or any
other poem with which we are all familiar. Now, I
think the way for Miss Gordon to find out the truth
of this matter would be to lock Marianne in a classroom
and tell her she will have to stay there until
she writes another poem of equal merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladys laughed. &ldquo;Poor Marianne! She would
be in there for the rest of her natural life, I fear.
Genius doesn&rsquo;t work that way. There was a pupil
here two years ago who composed music and said
the inspiration came to her at the queerest hours.
Once she went to the music room at three o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, and poor Miss Humphrey, who slept
just above, was terribly frightened. She thought the
music room was haunted. Maybe Marianne is the
same way. Maybe she has had the one inspiration
of her lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark eyes of Catherine flashed toward Gladys
scornfully. &ldquo;Since when have you taken to championing
Marianne Carnot? Perhaps you would like
to be numbered among her friends, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladys flushed and was about to retort when Joy
laughingly exclaimed: &ldquo;What a tempest in a teapot
we are trying to brew!&rdquo; Then, more seriously:
&ldquo;If Marianne wins the prize unfairly, her own heart
will punish her. Now I suggest that we all take
hands and play cartwheel on the ice until the gong
rings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>Half an hour later, flushed and warm, they were
trooping back to the school when little Peggy Paterson
ran out to meet them, calling: &ldquo;Muriel Storm,
Miss Widdemere wants you to stop at her office
before you go to your room. The mail just came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s heart leaped. Would there be a letter
from Gene?</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>There were two letters for Muriel bearing foreign
postmarks. One of them was addressed in a writing
strange to the girl, and she tore it open, almost with
dread, but this was quickly changed to joy, for the
letter was from her dear Uncle Barney.</p>
<p>The good priest had written it for him, as he did
so want Rilly to know that, Heaven willing, he and
his old mother would sail for America in the spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lonely I am for a look at me gal, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
lonely I am for me cabin down by the sea, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
lonely me cabin has been this long spell, closed there,
a-waitin&rsquo; for me,&rdquo; the letter ran.</p>
<p>The sympathetic young priest who had been scribe
had written the letter just as the kindly old Irishman
had dictated it, and it sounded so like her beloved
Uncle Barney that, for a moment, it was hard
for Muriel to keep from crying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be a different place that he&rsquo;ll be findin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
she thought, &ldquo;with the lighthouse but a tumbled
down heap of rocks and with grandfather gone. Oh,
I&rsquo;m that glad Uncle Barney&rsquo;s coming. I&rsquo;ll ask
Uncle Lem to take me to Tunkett just as soon as
they are back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Muriel opened the other envelope, which
was addressed in a handwriting with which she was
familiar, as Gene wrote very often to his &ldquo;storm
maiden.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Rilla,&rdquo; the lad had written, &ldquo;such an adventure
as I have had! At last the dull grey monotony
of living in England has ceased, for I have met
the most interesting man, and, for some reason unknown
to me, he invites my companionship. I
really can&rsquo;t believe that I interest him, for all I do
is listen while he talks so wonderfully about everything
that is inside books and out. If there is one
corner of this earth that he hasn&rsquo;t visited, I can&rsquo;t
imagine where it is. Oh, yes, Tunkett! I don&rsquo;t
suppose he has ever been there. In fact, it&rsquo;s such
an out-of-the-way place I don&rsquo;t suppose anybody
ever would find it unless he happened to be born
there, as Uncle Lem was, and I, of course, went to
visit him. Did I hear you inquire, &lsquo;Who is your
new friend?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel, I suppose I ought to be greatly impressed
with the fact that he is a viscount. People over here
treat him as though he were made of a very superior
kind of clay, my mother among them, but the
viscount himself isn&rsquo;t a bit flattered by the adulation
he receives. He calls it &lsquo;tommyrot,&rsquo; and whenever
there are social functions at the castle (honest Injun,
Rilla, that&rsquo;s what they call the turreted stone
pile in which he lives), he retires to his rustic log
cabin in the woods, which is so hedged in that
strangers could not even guess that it was there unless
they happened to stumble on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could tell you about the man himself
and do justice to him, but I simply can&rsquo;t. He has
the most boyish face I ever saw crowned with grey
hair. He tells me that he is forty-five years old, but
he seems nearer my age than any chap of twenty I
ever met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time I met him he suggested a hike
through Scotland. It seemed a good deal of an
undertaking, for I wasn&rsquo;t very strong (just beginning
to take short walks), but every day I grew
stronger, and what a week it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Viscount of Wainwater with a pack on his
back was not recognized by anyone. The boy in his
nature was very much in evidence that week. He
sang as we tramped along the deserted highways
and sometimes I knew that he was improvising.
Then it was that I made a discovery. He is the
Waine Waters whose vagabond poems so often appear
in American magazines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night we stopped at an out-of-the-way inn.
We had been tramping over a snow-covered moor
and, as we sat near the great fireplace where peat
was burning, he began to scribble and at last he
looked up and asked, &lsquo;Shall I read it to you?&rsquo; I
nodded, and, Muriel, that poem was a gem. It was
called &lsquo;The Moor in Winter,&rsquo; and told of the quiet
trust that is in the heart of all nature, for, although
the moor lies covered with snow, it is dreaming of
the spring that is to bring back the bird song and
the heather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked Waine (he told me to call him that) for
a copy of the poem, and he gave it to me. I had
planned sending it to you. I had it a week later
when I returned. I took it to the library to show
mother, but, finding that Monsieur Carnot and father
were there, I turned away. I have never seen it
since. I must have dropped it and the maid probably
thought it merely a scrap and burned it. I&rsquo;ll
ask Waine for another copy some day, but just now,
with his countess mother, he has gone away for a
fortnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it about time that you were writing a first
letter to your brother-friend,</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Gene Beavers</span>.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;P. S.&mdash;I have never mentioned you to Waine,
but if you are willing, I&rsquo;d like to show him that copy
of &lsquo;The Lonely Pelican&rsquo; which Doctor Winslow
sent me. Shall I?</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;Y. B., F. G.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>Scarcely had Muriel finished reading this letter
when Joy burst in with, &ldquo;Rilla, Miss Gordon has
called an assembly for two o&rsquo;clock this afternoon.
We are all so excited, for this is only done on very
especial occasions. What do you suppose has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it has anything to do with the contest?&rdquo;
Faith said softly, as she and Muriel found
unoccupied chairs near their three friends, who were
already seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My opinion is that Miss Gordon merely wishes
to announce the name of the winner of the prize,
and as we would not again be assembled until Monday,
except in the dining hall and chapel, she has
taken this method of bringing us together.&rdquo; And
Joy was right.</p>
<p>Miss Gordon&rsquo;s smile, as she entered with Miss
Humphrey and Miss Widdemere, was so pleasant
that it at once quieted the fears of the senior girls
that something had gone wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although only a small group of you are interested
in the poetry contest,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I wish you
all to hear the three poems that have been pronounced
best by a most able judge, who is the Professor
of English literature at Columbia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first prize has been awarded to Marianne
Carnot, the second to Muriel Storm, and the third to
Joy Kiersey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a rustle among the girls, all of whom
turned to look at the honored three.</p>
<p>Muriel and Joy were not surprised at the announcement
that the winner had been Marianne Carnot,
but they had not known that a second and third
prize had been offered.</p>
<p>They made no whispered comment, however, as
Miss Gordon was again speaking. &ldquo;I am going to
ask the three girls, beginning with Joy, then Muriel,
and then Marianne, to come to the platform and
read aloud the really excellent poems which they
have submitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith noticed that the eyes of this kind principal
never left the dark, handsome face of the French
girl, and she also noticed that Marianne did not look
up even when her name was mentioned.</p>
<p>After all, Faith decided, the meeting had a deeper
purpose than that for which it had been called.</p>
<p>Joy, with her flower-like face flushed, read the
poem, which she really knew by heart, so sympathetically,
and the plaint of the Indian maid so appealed
to her listeners, that they wondered how the
other two poems could be better.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s poem, although showing more real talent,
was not read as well, and the pupils were still
inclined to believe that Joy&rsquo;s should, at least, have
had second place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Marianne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faith and Catherine watched the French girl, and
for that matter, so did Miss Gordon and Miss Humphrey,
but the winner of the first prize seemed to
be in no way disconcerted. She stood up and her
dark eyes looked directly into those of Miss Gordon
as she took the manuscript.</p>
<p>Everyone had to acknowledge that Marianne read
well, but what was she reading? From the very announcement
of the title, Muriel had leaned forward,
her breath coming in little gasps, her face suddenly
pale, her hands clasped tensely.</p>
<p>Marianne, having read her poem through to the
end, walked down the aisle between the girls to her
former seat, but she could not resist sending a
glance of triumph toward Muriel. The clear hazel
eyes that looked back at her were scornful and accusing.
Marianne quickly seated herself, a deep red
flush suffusing her face.</p>
<p>Within her heart was the certainty that Muriel
knew, but how could she?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>And Muriel did know, for the title of the poem
which Marianne had read was &ldquo;Winter on the
Moor.&rdquo; Muriel left the other girls directly after the
meeting and hurried to her own room. She wanted
to be alone to think, but this she was not permitted
to do. Almost immediately there came a tap on her
door and Faith was admitted. With her hands on
the shoulders of her friend, she looked deep into the
hazel eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will keep it a secret
if you wish. What is troubling you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel turned and taking Gene&rsquo;s letter from its
envelope, she read aloud his description of the viscount
and the poem by Waine Waters entitled &ldquo;The
Moor in Winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very poem that won the prize for Marianne,&rdquo;
Faith exclaimed. &ldquo;Her father must have found and
sent it to her. What shall you do about it? Marianne
will, of course, be expelled when the truth is
known. Last year when Miss Gordon enumerated
the ideals of High Cliffs, she mentioned plagiarism
as being one of the greatest of misdemeanors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not mention it,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.
&ldquo;Now let us forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poetry contest was soon a thing of the past,
for everyone was thinking and planning for the
Christmas holidays that were but two weeks away.</p>
<p>However, it was noticeable that Marianne Carnot
never again chose verse as the form of her compositions.
Her classmates were not interested
enough to speculate about it, but Miss Gordon and
Miss Humphrey believed that some day they would
know the truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<h2 id="c35"><br />CHAPTER XXXV.
<br />MURIEL WRITES A LETTER.</h2>
<p>Meanwhile Muriel had a problem of her own to
settle. She had been invited to spend the holidays in
the homes of her two best friends, and did not
know what to do, as she wished to accept both invitations,
but that, of course, was impossible. Then
it was that the matter was decided for her in a most
unexpected and delightful manner. Doctor Winslow
had been a frequent Sunday visitor at the school
(for was not his protege one of the pupils?) and
each time there had been a cozy party in Miss Gordon&rsquo;s
charming &ldquo;den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kindly physician had noticed an expression of
weariness in the eyes of the older woman as though
the responsibility of training so many girls was
bearing heavily upon her and he had suddenly decided
that what she needed was a complete change
of scene; and, as he had often heard Miss Gordon
express a desire to visit Tunkett, he offered his home
to her and to Muriel for the midwinter vacation,
assuring them that he had already communicated
with his housekeeper, who lived in a neighboring
cottage, and that both Brazilla Mullet and her
brother Jabez would look after their every comfort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>Muriel was seated in her low chair on the side of
the fireplace opposite Miss Gordon when that little
woman, her eyes glowing, her cheeks faintly flushed,
read aloud the letter which she had received from
the brother of her long-ago classmate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Gordon, shall we go? How wonderful
it would be,&rdquo; Muriel exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll just love
Tunkett and the dear queer people. Of course they
don&rsquo;t seem queer to me, but they surely are different.
I can&rsquo;t imagine them living anywhere else but just
in Tunkett. I love them all, every one of them, even
old Cap&rsquo;n Sam Peters, I do believe. Grand-dad used
to say that Cap&rsquo;n Sam was too lazy to haul in a
cod even when he had him well hooked. Then there&rsquo;s
Mrs. Sam Peters and all the other fisherfolk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How happy little Zoeth Wixon will be when he
sees me! I hope no one will tell him that I&rsquo;m coming.
I want to surprise him and Shags. Oh, Miss
Gordon, won&rsquo;t Shags be the happiest dog in all this
world when he hears my voice? Nobody knows
how lonely I&rsquo;ve been for my shaggy comrade, but it
made Zoeth so happy to keep him and I couldn&rsquo;t
have him here. I must take everyone of them a
Christmas present. What fun that will be! Little
Zoeth used to call me his &lsquo;story-gal&rsquo; because I told
him the tales Uncle Barney had told to me. Oh,
I know what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll buy him a book full of pictures
of fairies and giants. Zoey is going to the
village school this winter and if I choose a book
with short words in it and big print, he may be able
to read the stories all by himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what shall I get for Linda Wixon? Something
bright and pretty to wear. That&rsquo;s what she
was always wishing for,&rdquo; Muriel ended breathlessly.</p>
<p>Miss Gordon leaned back in the shadow and
watched the eager face of the girl whose hair was
growing coppery in the firelight. Then suddenly
Muriel&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears and her lips quivered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to think how lonely I&rsquo;ll be without
Grand-dad,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but somehow I&rsquo;d rather go
home this first Christmas than anywhere else. I
really would.&rdquo; Then she added ruefully: &ldquo;Miss
Gordon, here I am chattering on just as though we
were <i>really</i> going, and you haven&rsquo;t even said that
you like the plan. Would you rather go somewhere
else, for, if you would, I can visit Faith or Joy, for
they have both invited me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really want to go with you to Tunkett, Muriel,&rdquo;
was the earnest reply. &ldquo;I think it is a beautiful plan.
I want to just rest and feel the sweep of the salt
wind, and forget, for a time, that I have the responsibility
of training sixty-two young ladies in the
ways that they should go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>Then, as was their wont, these two who understood
each other sat quietly gazing into the fire,
dreaming their dreams. To Miss Gordon, who for
so many years had had no one to lean upon, it
seemed indeed wonderful to find someone at last who
wanted to plan for her comfort and happiness, and
lonely Muriel felt that she would rather spend this
first Christmas since her grand-dad had gone with
the simple folk who had known him and loved him.
Faith and Joy indeed were disappointed when they
heard that their beloved Muriel was not to spend the
holidays with them in their New York homes.</p>
<p>These girls had planned to share their island
friend and many were the surprises they had in
store for her, but when they realized how much it
meant to Rilla to go to the little fishing village that
she called home, they did not let her know of the
plans they had made for her pleasure, nor need they
be entirely abandoned, merely postponed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I do wish you could both come down to
Tunkett for a week-end while I am there,&rdquo; Muriel
exclaimed one day when Joy and Faith had dropped
into her cupola room for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a hotel in the town?&rdquo; Joy asked eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>How Rilla laughed. &ldquo;Nothing like the one to
which Miss Widdemere took us last week when we
were in New York,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;However there is
an inn very like the one about which you were reading,
Faith, in that magazine story. In fact, the fishing
village might almost have been Tunkett, I do
believe. Perhaps all New England coast towns are
much alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; Faith declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
wanted to really see with my own eyes a village like
the one in that story, haven&rsquo;t you, Joy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their Dresden China girl laughingly agreed that
the one desire of her life was to visit just such a
place, and that, if all went well, they would surprise
Muriel by appearing at the inn in Tunkett for at
least one week-end of the vacation which was but a
fortnight away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what jolly fun that will be,&rdquo; Rilla exclaimed.
&ldquo;Girls, I believe something wonderful is going to
happen to me during the Christmas holidays. I feel
it, though I can&rsquo;t tell what it is to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope so,&rdquo; Faith said. Then, after a
hesitating moment, she asked: &ldquo;Dear, have you
ever wished that you might know who your own
father is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s face grew suddenly pale and there were
tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I want him,&rdquo; she said slowly and in
a voice quivering with emotion, &ldquo;since he did not
care for me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>Faith&rsquo;s arms were about her. &ldquo;Dear, dear girl,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;do forgive me for having spoken of your
father. I didn&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I understand.&rdquo; Muriel smiled through
her tears as she held out a hand to her other dearest
friend, who stood silently near, her sweet face expressing
tender sympathy. &ldquo;I know nothing whatever
about my father. If Grand-dad knew about
him, he never told me. He had promised to tell me
all about my girl-mother&rsquo;s marriage when I was
eighteen years of age. I am nearly that now, but
Grand-dad is not here. I do not believe that anyone
else knows. I have often wanted to ask Uncle
Barney, but since Grand-dad died I haven&rsquo;t seemed
to care. I have felt that if my own father could
desert his baby girl, surely he would not want her
when she was grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How deeply Faith regretted that she had spoken
to Muriel of her unknown father, but it was done
and could not be helped.</p>
<p>All that day, as Rilla went about her tasks, she
could think of nothing else. How she hoped that
some day she would find that she had been wronging
the man whom her girl-mother had loved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>How wonderful it would be, she thought, to have
someone who would be her very own to love her as
her grand-dad had loved her. Everyone was kind,
but no one could quite take the place in the heart of
Muriel of the three for whom she prayed ever since
she was a child&mdash;the girl-mother who had died, the
grand-dad who had sheltered her, and the father
who never came. How she loved them all, and how
she longed for them.</p>
<p>Why, just then, she should have thought of her
brother-friend she could not have told, but she did
think of him, and she resolved that just as soon as
the lessons for the day were done she would write
Gene Beavers that first letter for which he had so
long and patiently waited.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Gene Beavers was just leaving the house in which
he lived with his parents and sister on the outskirts
of London when a maid recalled him to give him the
morning mail. She wondered at the sudden brightening
of his expression. He glanced at the several
envelopes, tossed all but one back upon the hall table
unopened, slipped that one into his pocket and again
went out. He wanted to read this very first letter
from his &ldquo;storm maiden&rdquo; by the stream in the Wainwater
Woods. He was on his way to spend the day
with his boon companion, the viscount. Wonderful
days they were that these two spent together, sometimes
galloping across country on horseback and at
other times hiking, stopping in lovely secluded places
to rest, read and dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>A stranger would not have guessed that the lad
had so recently been an invalid, for his face once
more was bronzed by the wind and sun, and in his
eagerness to reach his destination, he fairly ran down
the deserted highway. Having reached a sheltered
spot, he threw himself down upon the bank of the
stream, took the letter from his pocket and looked
admiringly at the neat and really pretty handwriting.
He had known that Muriel did not intend to send
him a letter until she could write well and form her
sentences correctly, but, even so, he was surprised
with the contents of her missive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Brother-Friend,&rdquo; he read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I first came here, I felt as one of my white
gulls might if after years of winging through the
sunlit air, being swept hither and thither and yon by
restless winds, of dipping into the surf when it
would, it had suddenly found itself in a cage, barred
in. But now I am glad that I was caught and kept
in a cage, for I have learned much. I have always
known how to dream, Brother-Friend, but, oh, the
wonder of it, for now I can write my dreams and
send them to the far-away place where you are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cannot be a real letter but I did so want to
tell you that the cage door is to be open for two
long weeks, and that I am going with our dear Miss
Gordon, whom you know, to spend the Christmas
vacation at Tunkett. How I wish that you were
going to be there, as you were last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the day we raced with Shags
on the sand, and your sister came and Marianne
Carnot? How long, long ago that seems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bell calling us to Politeness Class is ringing,
and I&rsquo;ll have to say goodbye for now, but I&rsquo;ll
write you from Tunkett and tell you how everything
and everyone looks. You quite won the heart of
Brazilla Mullet. Shall you write to me while I am
there?</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;Your Sister-Friend,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Rilla of the Storms</span>.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;P. S.&mdash;Of course you may show &lsquo;The Lonely
Pelican&rsquo; to your new friend if you wish, although it
will not interest a real poet, as Miss Gordon tells me
that Waine Waters truly is.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;M. S.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>Leaping to his feet, Gene continued on his way to
the cabin hidden in the depths of the wood, where
his comrade, the Viscount of Wainwater, was impatiently
awaiting his coming.</p>
<p>The older man was growing restless. He seldom
remained so long in England, and he was preparing
to start on a journey, perhaps to the Nile, and he
wanted Gene to be his traveling companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<h2 id="c36"><br />CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br />MURIEL VISITS TUNKETT AGAIN.</h2>
<p>Doctor Winslow accompanied Miss Gordon and
Muriel to the little coast village of Tunkett. It was
twilight when the leisurely train at last stopped at
the station and Jabez appeared through the flurry of
snow driving the doctor&rsquo;s old horse and two-seated
buggy. The side curtains were up and on the back
seat the woman and the girl were soon made comfortable.</p>
<p>How Miss Gordon was enjoying every moment
of the quaint experience of being suddenly transported
from the atmosphere of a fashionable girls&rsquo;
school and from the most modern city in the world
to this old-fashioned hamlet which had changed but
little in one hundred years.</p>
<p>The wagon jolted along, for the road was full of
frozen ruts, and Muriel laughed gleefully as she
was thrown against the older woman. She knew
that she was laughing to keep from crying, but, oh,
how hard it was, how much harder even than she
had supposed that it would be, this coming back to
Tunkett and no grand-dad there to meet her. But
she would lock her grief in her heart, she bravely
resolved, and devote the next two weeks to bringing
rest and recreation to the dear friend who had
devoted so much of her free time during the past
months to teaching and helping her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>As they turned into the road, the booming of the
breakers could plainly be heard and the penetrating
cold, salty wind from the sea reached even the sheltered
back seat; but, before Miss Gordon or Muriel
could be chilled, they were turning into a driveway,
and, with unexpected suddenness, Methuselah
stopped at a stepping block near the side veranda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have to say whoa to this ol&rsquo; horse,&rdquo; Jabez
boasted. &ldquo;Allays knows when he&rsquo;s put into the
home port and just whar he&rsquo;s to dock without
tellin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doctor Winslow laughed as he sprang out and
unfastened the side curtains preparatory to assisting
Miss Gordon to alight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jabez,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you and Methuselah belong
to a mutual admiration society, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fust rate friends, if that&rsquo;s what yer meanin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
the old man declared with a chuckle, &ldquo;but
horses are much the same as humans, I take it; if
you like them, why turn about they like you.&rdquo; Then,
as the suitcase had been removed, he picked up the
reins. &ldquo;Heave ahead, Methuselah, we&rsquo;ll cruise down
to your anchorage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>Miss Gordon laughed. &ldquo;Does the old horse understand
what he means?&rdquo; &ldquo;Indeed, he does,&rdquo; the
physician assured her; then, as the side door opened
letting out into the snowy dusk a welcome flood of
light, he called to the thin, neatly dressed woman
who appeared there: &ldquo;Here we are, Brazilla, bag
and baggage! Miss Gordon, this is the sister of
Jabez Mullet and the maker of the most famous
chowder on the coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper accepted Miss Gordon&rsquo;s hand,
but turned at once to the tall, slender girl who stood
in the background smiling at her just a bit wistfully.
&ldquo;Rilla, Rilla Storm, &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t you! It can&rsquo;t be!
They&rsquo;ve gone and made you over into a young lady
such as comes here summers to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper actually was wiping tears from
her eyes with one corner of her immaculate apron.
In a moment the girl&rsquo;s arms were about her. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
me, Brazilla. Maybe my clothes are different, but
my heart&rsquo;s the same. I couldn&rsquo;t ever change inside.&rdquo;
Doctor Winslow had led Miss Gordon into the
warm, cheerful living room, and so, for a moment,
the two old friends were alone in the entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno what made me cry,&rdquo; Miss Mullet was
saying. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t guess what it means to me
havin&rsquo; you come for Christmas, Rilla. I sorter wish
Gene Beavers was comin&rsquo;, too. It&rsquo;d be kind of a
family gatherin&rsquo;. But thar, I&rsquo;m forgettin&rsquo; the biscuits
that&rsquo;s in the oven and me wantin&rsquo; &rsquo;em to be just
the crispy brown the way Doctor Lem likes &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>For a moment Muriel stood alone in the entrance
hall, thinking of all that had happened since she
stood there before. Then she heard a sweet voice
calling to her. &ldquo;Yes, Miss Gordon, I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>
<p>Half an hour later all were seated about a festive
board and Miss Gordon declared that of such delicious
homey cooking she had not partaken since
she was a girl.</p>
<p>A kerosene lamp, with a rose-colored shade, hung
above the middle of the table and on the snowy cloth
were the old-fashioned white dishes with gold borders
that had belonged, in the long ago, to the mother
of Doctor Lem.</p>
<p>The physician glanced over a flowering rose geranium
which adorned the center of the table and
smiled at Miss Gordon, who sat opposite, as he exclaimed
with sincere appreciation: &ldquo;You are right,
Helen; I have traveled the world over, but nowhere
have I found anyone who can cook to please me as
can Brazilla Mullet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was what Doctor Lem said, but in the silent
moment that followed his thoughts added that it
was indeed pleasant to see the sweet face of Miss
Gordon smiling at him from the other end of the
table. The old house had not really been a home to
him since his sister and mother had died but a few
months apart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>The color in Miss Gordon&rsquo;s checks deepened as
she met his gaze, or, perhaps, it was but the reflection
from the rose-colored lampshade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brazilla, do tell me the news,&rdquo; Muriel was saying.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just sure that something interesting must
have happened. Have you seen Shags, and poor
little crippled Zoeth lately, and how are Mrs. Sol
and little Sol and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One question at a time if you want them answered,
Rilla,&rdquo; Doctor Lem smiled at the girl, who
was seated at his right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see little Zoey every day, and Shags, too,&rdquo; Miss
Brazilla replied, &ldquo;and as for news, I should say
there was some. Hasn&rsquo;t Doctor Lem told you&mdash;oh,
I guess he wants to surprise you with it,&rdquo; she concluded
as she caught a glance from the physician&rsquo;s
smiling grey eyes which she rightly interpreted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be surprised, all right,&rdquo; Jabez remarked,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; glad, too, like the rest of us was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Lem, when am I to know?&rdquo; The girl
turned eager, glowing eyes toward the physician and
searched his face, but his expression was inscrutable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened? I do believe that it is
something about the Wixons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>Brazilla rose just then to replenish the biscuits,
and when she returned she exclaimed beamingly:
&ldquo;Jabe and I have another surprise for you, Rilla, and
this one even Doctor Lem don&rsquo; know. He&rsquo;ll be jest
as s&rsquo;prised an&rsquo; pleased as you&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodie!&rdquo; ejaculated Muriel in little girl
fashion. &ldquo;Then there are two surprises awaiting me.
When am I to find them out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, if the weather&rsquo;s fine, or even if
&rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t suppose that foul weather could keep
you anchored in port when ye&rsquo;ve friends expectin&rsquo;
you over on the sand dunes.&rdquo; This from Jabez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; the girl retorted. &ldquo;The wildest
tempest that ever raged over this coast couldn&rsquo;t
keep me from going to see Zoey and Shags the first
thing tomorrow morning. There&rsquo;s one thing,
though, I&rsquo;m sort of dreading, and that&rsquo;s seeing dear
old Uncle Barney&rsquo;s cabin boarded up and looking so
lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, turning to Captain Mullet, she continued:
&ldquo;Jabez, some day soon will you sail Miss Gordon
and me over to Windy Island? I want to find my
lame pelican if he is there and feed the gulls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, Rilla, I&rsquo;ll cruise ye over thar mos&rsquo; any time
the wind&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take any chances,&rdquo; Doctor Winslow
warned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>He suddenly realized that the two who would be
passengers were very precious to him and he did not
want to lose them. Then he rebuked himself. It
was presumptuous for a man nearing sixty to think
that as wonderful a woman as Miss Gordon could
care for him. He would put the thought from him
and think of her only as a dear friend.</p>
<p>Doctor Lem returned to the city that night, but
promised to run down again in a few days and if
possible remain over Christmas. Miss Gordon and
Muriel retired early to the big upper chamber, where
a glowing bed of embers on the hearth was sending
forth its warmth, but it was long before either of
them slept, for each was dreaming dreams as they
listened to the intermittent wail of the foghorn, to
the distant boom of the surf on the rocks, and to the
rush and swish of the snow beating against the
windows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<h2 id="c37"><br />CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br />MURIEL SURPRISED.</h2>
<p>Muriel had intended to arise very early the next
morning, but so late had she fallen asleep, though
she had retired early enough, that it was not until
Brazilla came to make a fire on the hearth that the
girl awakened.</p>
<p>Miss Gordon, too, opened her eyes, and Muriel,
sitting up in bed, exclaimed joyfully: &ldquo;Oh, what a
wonderful day! All out-of-doors is white and
sparkling; the sky is so blue and the sunshine so
bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brazilla, would right after breakfast be too soon
to start out to find those two surprises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wear my leggins, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
Brazilla declared. &ldquo;The snow&rsquo;ll be above your shoe-tops
easy and more than that at the drifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later Muriel appeared in the doorway
of the large sun-flooded living room and Miss Gordon
glanced up at her from the book she was
reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Muriel, you look stouter than usual,&rdquo; was
her puzzled comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; Rilla laughingly confessed. &ldquo;I do
believe that Brazilla has put on me two layers of
everything that she could find, including the leggins
and her warm red hood. Jack Frost will have a
hard time finding a place to nip. Goodbye, Miss
Gordon. I&rsquo;ll be back by noon. I know that you are
going to have a wonderful two hours just resting
and reading.&rdquo; Then she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew that one could have so many different
kinds of emotions at the same time,&rdquo; Muriel
was thinking as she started down the snowy road
that led to the sand dunes where stood the scattered
homes of her fisherfolk friends.</p>
<p>A queer looking settlement it was, for each
squatter had built his cabin facing in whatever direction
his particular fancy had suggested. A few had
preferred to face the town and others had their
front dooryards on the side toward the sea, but as
there were from one hundred to two hundred feet
of sand dune between each shack no one interfered
with his neighbor.</p>
<p>Muriel purposely went a roundabout way to
avoid passing the boarded-up cabin of her Uncle
Barney. Tears sprang to her eyes as she thought of
him. How she longed to see that dear, faithful old
man who had been her grand-dad&rsquo;s closest friend
and comrade through many years, but she would
have to wait until spring. Even then she doubted
if he would be able to bring his old mother, who was
very feeble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>She did not even glance in that direction when she
reached the sand dunes, but went at once to the
cabin of the Wixons.</p>
<p>She whistled the old familiar call. A short, joyous
bark was heard in reply, the cabin door opened
and out leaped a dog, grown larger, perhaps; her
own beloved Shags! If there had been in her heart
a fear that he might have forgotten her, it was soon
dispelled. The joy expressed in every move that he
made told as plainly as words could have done that
here was the one person in all the world whom he
loved best. Down on the snow the girl knelt, her
arms were about her shaggy friend, her face for a
moment hidden in the long, silky hair at his neck.
Oh, how hard it was not to sob!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shagsie! My Shagsie!&rdquo; the girl cried, but just
at that moment the joyous voice of a boy was heard.
Looking up, Rilla saw a little lad emerging from the
cabin. She sprang to her feet and stared in uncomprehending
amazement.</p>
<p>Surely it was Zoeth; but where were his crutches?
He was running toward her down the recently
shoveled path, his arms held out to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zoey!&rdquo; Muriel exclaimed, catching the little fellow
and holding him close. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not crippled
any more. Darling laddie, what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>The small boy clapped his hands and hopped up
and down. &ldquo;I wanted to s&rsquo;prise you. I tol&rsquo;
Doctor Lem not to tell you. He did it,
Rilla! He mended me, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been months
doin&rsquo; it! He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to send me to a boys&rsquo; school
next year, Rilla. Doctor Lem says he&rsquo;s going to
make me into a shipbuilder.&rdquo; How the lad&rsquo;s eyes
were glowing. &ldquo;You know how Uncle Barney used
to teach me to make little ships and how I&rsquo;d love to
draw pictures of &rsquo;em. Well, Doctor Lem looked
&rsquo;em over once, and that&rsquo;s how he got the notion of
sendin&rsquo; me away to a school whar I could learn how
to do it right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of this joyous chatter, the small boy
stopped as though he had suddenly thought of something.
&ldquo;Rilly,&rdquo; he said, his face eagerly questioning,
&ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t come along by the sand dunes, did
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel gazed down at the snow or out at the
ocean, anywhere but ahead where she knew she
would have to see the boarded-up cottage toward
which Zoeth was fairly dragging her. Shags
bounded along at her side barking joyfully.</p>
<p>At last the child could keep quiet no longer.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look, Rilly?&rdquo; he queried eagerly.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you look?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>He had stopped directly in front of the cabin
which had been so much in her thoughts, and so
Muriel was obliged to lift her eyes. Why, what
could it mean? The windows were not boarded up
as she had expected to find them. There was smoke
coming out of the chimney and a geranium was
blossoming on the sun-flooded window sill. For a
moment the girl felt rebellious.</p>
<p>Was some one else living in Uncle Barney&rsquo;s
house? She was sure that he would not wish it to
be occupied until he came, and yet, on second
thought, she knew that it could be inhabited only
with his consent. Then she looked down at her
companion&rsquo;s glowing face. All at once she read the
meaning of the happy light that she saw in his eyes.
&ldquo;Zoey,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Uncle Barney has come back?&rdquo;
At the sound of his name, the door was thrown
open and the bronzed old sea captain sprang out
and caught the amazed girl in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll just have to cry now,&rdquo; Rilla sobbed as
she clung to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried so hard not to. I
tried to be brave when I saw Shags and Zoey, but,
Uncle Barney, how I have wanted you since my
grand-dad left me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know, colleen. Cry all you want to.
It&rsquo;s yer Uncle Barney that understands. It&rsquo;s me as
lost me ol&rsquo; mither, an&rsquo; so arter all, she niver can
come to see the little home I had a-waitin&rsquo; for her
here by the sea; but, dearie, it&rsquo;s better off she is in
the lovely land she&rsquo;s gone to.&rdquo; Then, almost shyly,
he added: &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t come back alone, Rilly.
&rsquo;Twas me mither&rsquo;s dyin&rsquo; wish that I bring Molly
O&rsquo;Connell to be keepin&rsquo; the little cabin for me. Dry
yer tears now, mavourneen, and come in an&rsquo; meet
me Molly, and try to be lovin&rsquo; her, too, for yer ol&rsquo;
Uncle Barney&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the girl into the cabin and called to someone
who was busy in the kitchen corner. Muriel
decided at once that it would not be hard to love the
Irish woman, who, though elderly, was as blooming
as a late rose, with her ruddy cheeks and twinkling
blue eyes that held in their merry depths eternal
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molly&rsquo;s the wife I&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo; for ever since
she was a gal,&rdquo; Uncle Barney said as he laid an arm
lovingly on the shoulders over which a gay red and
yellow plaid shawl was folded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>Then he told how they had been sweethearts when
they were lad and lassie in the long, long ago, but
that his Molly had married another, and that was
why Barney had come to America to live, but he
had always been faithful to his first love, and at last
they were to be together through the sunset of life.
&ldquo;This little ol&rsquo; cabin&rsquo;s a real home now, Rilly gal,&rdquo;
the old man said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s yer home, too, colleen, if
ever yer needin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>An hour later, when Muriel stood in Doctor Lem&rsquo;s
kitchen warming her fingers over the fire in the great
old-fashioned stove, she said:	&ldquo;Brazilla, I hardly
know which of your two surprises was the most wonderful.
To think that dear, brave little Zoey is to
have his chance and all because of that kind man,
Doctor Winslow. I am sure that Zoeth Wixon will
make us all proud of him, but weren&rsquo;t you surprised
when Uncle Barney came home with a wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I was. Nothin&rsquo; could surprise me more
&rsquo;less &rsquo;twould be Doctor Lem&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; home with a
wife; but that&rsquo;s not likely to happen, though I sure
sartin wish it might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment Muriel thought of something.
She had noticed the night before that Doctor
Winslow often had looked over the rose geranium at
lovely Miss Gordon, and surely in his eyes there
had been&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Her thoughts were interrupted with: &ldquo;Rilly,
&rsquo;sposin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; take in the platter o&rsquo; fried fish an&rsquo; tell
Miss Gordon as everything&rsquo;s dished up an&rsquo; ready.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<h2 id="c38"><br />CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br />MURIEL VISITS WINDY ISLAND.</h2>
<p>Uncle Barney had done a good deal of thinking
since he had returned to his cabin in the sand dunes.
He was recalling a visit he had received from Captain
Ezra Bassett a short time before he set sail for
Ireland. It was then that Muriel&rsquo;s grand-dad had
told him all that he knew of the girl&rsquo;s own father,
and at the end of the story he had said: &ldquo;If anything
happens to me, Barney, like as not Rilla&rsquo;s own
dad would be the right one for her to go to. You
can allays reach him by writin&rsquo; to the address that&rsquo;s
in the little iron box whar the tools &rsquo;r&rsquo; kept for fixin&rsquo;
the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How well Barney remembered that little iron
box. It had been on many a sea voyage when Ezra
had been in command of the two-masted schooner
The Stormy Petrel, and the faithful Irishman had
been first mate.</p>
<p>Then, when the older man had settled on Windy
Island, Barney had often seen the box in the small
closet at the top of the tower where the oil can, tools
and cleaning rags were kept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>What ought he to do about it? he ruminated as
he sat near his glowing stove on the day following
Muriel&rsquo;s visit and smoked pipe after pipe in thoughtful
silence.</p>
<p>Ought he to tell the girl, and yet, now that the
tower was but a fallen heap of stones, would it be
possible for them to find the little iron box?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s colleen herself as shall do the decidin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
at last determined. Rising, he put on his heavy
coat, cap and the scarlet muffler that Molly had knitted
for him and telling his good wife that he might
not be back until late, he started walking toward the
home of Doctor Winslow.</p>
<p>Muriel was out on the veranda sweeping away
the light snow that had fallen in the night. &ldquo;Top
o&rsquo; the morning to you, Uncle Barney,&rdquo; she called as
she waved the broom. &ldquo;Have you come to invite
me to take a cruise with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled up at her as he ascended the
steps, and yet, so well did the girl know him, that she
at once sensed that something was troubling him.
However, it was in his usual cheerful manner that
he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mind reader that you are, Rilly gal, for
&rsquo;twas that very thing I was after thinkin&rsquo;. I cal&rsquo;lated
I&rsquo;d cruise over to Windy Island, this mornin&rsquo;
and I was hopin&rsquo; as how you&rsquo;d like to go along as
crew.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>There were sudden tears in the hazel eyes of the
girl as she held the old man&rsquo;s warmly mittened hand
in a firm clasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Barney,&rdquo; she said with a suspicion of a
sob in her voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be goin&rsquo; there for the
first time with you than with anyone else in all the
world, perhaps because my grand-dad loved you just
as he would had you been his brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; the kind-hearted Irishman
assured her. Then to hide his own emotion he hurried
on to say: &ldquo;Bundle up warm, Rilly gal, for
though &rsquo;tis sunny, the air is powerful nippin&rsquo;. I
reckon you&rsquo;d better be tellin&rsquo; your folks as how you
may be late comin&rsquo; back to sort o&rsquo; get &rsquo;em out of
the notion o&rsquo; worryin&rsquo;. Tell &rsquo;em yer ol&rsquo; Uncle Barney&rsquo;ll
land you in the home port safe an&rsquo; sound
along about sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Muriel was surprised to hear that they
might remain so long on Windy Island, she made
no comment but skipped into the house to put on
her wraps and tell Miss Gordon of the planned voyage.
Uncle Barney had not said that he wished
only Muriel to accompany him, but the girl was
sure that the captain had something that he wished
to say to her alone. Perhaps her grand-dad had
asked him to sometime tell her about the marriage
of her girl-mother. How she hoped this might be so.
But of her thoughts Muriel said nothing as they
tramped together out on the snow-covered wharf
near which the captain&rsquo;s dory was anchored.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>It was not until they were sailing in the smoother
waters on the sheltered side of the island that Ezra
Bassett&rsquo;s old friend told the girl he had so loved
why he had brought her that day to visit the ruined
lighthouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Barney,&rdquo; the girl looked across at him
hopefully, eagerly, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you be telling me all
that you know about my girl-mother and my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, colleen dearie, thar ain&rsquo;t much to tell.
Your pa, it &rsquo;peared like to us as saw him, was a poor
artist fellow as came one summer to this here coast
to make pictures. Yer ma, darlin&rsquo;, was jest like yo&rsquo;
are now; the two of yo&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t be told apart. That
artist fellow met up wi&rsquo; her in the store, Mrs. Sol
tol&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; would do arter that but he must
make a paintin&rsquo; of that other Rilla a-settin&rsquo; up on
the rocks. He was mighty takin&rsquo; in his ways, I&rsquo;ll
say that for him, an&rsquo; upstandin&rsquo;, too. I&rsquo;d a-sworn
from the little I saw of him that he&rsquo;d be a square
dealer, but like be I was wrong, for when your
grand-dad got wind of him courtin&rsquo; his gal, fer
that&rsquo;s what it had come to by the end of the summer,
ol&rsquo; Ezra tol&rsquo; him to clear out. Yo&rsquo;re ma pleaded
pitiful-like, but yo&rsquo; know that look yer grand-dad
used to get when he was sot, an&rsquo; sot hard. That&rsquo;s
the way he looked then. Wall, the next day that
artist fellow was gone, but so, too, was the gal ol&rsquo;
Ezra Bassett had set sech a store by.&rdquo; The kindly
Irishman dreaded telling the rest of the story as it
reflected no credit to the honor of the lighthouse-keeper
and he was glad indeed to find that the dock
had been reached. Nor did the girl question him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>Even Captain Barney did not know how hard it
was for Muriel to climb the snow-covered flight of
steps that led to the only home her girlhood had
ever known, and then, when the top was reached, to
see that home lying one rock heaped upon another,
the whole jagged mass covered with a sparkling
white blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little iron box that you were telling me
about, Uncle Barney,&rdquo; Rilla began as she smiled
bravely up at her companion, &ldquo;since it was kept near
the lamp, don&rsquo;t you think that in falling they would
lie near each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man nodded. &ldquo;I reckon so,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; yet thar&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo;. A reg&rsquo;lar tornado &rsquo;twas
a-racin&rsquo; along the coast that day, and what with the
lightnin&rsquo; hitting the tower and the wind twistin&rsquo; it,
things that fell might o&rsquo; got purty much scattered
about, seems like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>Going to the old shed at the foot of the steps, the
captain procured shovels and a broom and together
they began to remove the snow from the rocks that
were nearest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like looking for a needle in a haystack,&rdquo; the
girl declared when they had worked for an hour and
had not discovered the great lamp which for so
many years had swung its circling light over the
darkened sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems powerful quare to me whar that big lantern
can be,&rdquo; the old man said at last, as he leaned
on the handle of his shovel to rest. &ldquo;&rsquo;Pears like it
ought&rsquo;ve fallen on top o&rsquo; the heap, bein&rsquo; as it was
the highest up; but &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t here, sure sartin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel, standing on the uncovered rocks, looked
down at him. &ldquo;Uncle Barney,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you
suppose that someone has carried the lamp away to
sell for old iron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain shook his head. &ldquo;No, Rilly gal, I
reckon not. It&rsquo;s government property and no one&rsquo;d
be likely to cart it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noon they went down to the little beach shed.
The Irishman made a fire in the rusty old stove and
they sat near, appreciating its warmth while they
ate the good lunch that Molly had prepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Barney,&rdquo; the girl exclaimed half an
hour later, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s me as is goin&rsquo; to take the crumbs
and left-over bits to the top of the cliff and see if I
can coax the seagulls from the caves; that is, if they
are there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>It was well that Brazilla Mullet had insisted that
the girl wear her thick woolen leggins, for she had
to wade through deep, unbroken drifts of snow to
reach the spot where so often she had stood to feed
her bird friends; but though she called and called,
the gulls that in former winters had appeared from
the warm caves in the rocks did not respond; not
even the lone pelican which she had hoped would
come.</p>
<p>Almost sadly the girl was turning away when she
chanced to look over the steep cliff and there, half
way down, firmly wedged between an outjutting
ledge and a small twisted pine, she saw something
that sent her leaping back toward the fallen tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Barney,&rdquo; she called excitedly. &ldquo;Come
quick! I&rsquo;ve found it! I&rsquo;ve found the lamp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Irishman was soon at her side. Rilla
looked up with tears in her eyes as she said: &ldquo;Poor
thing, how forlorn it looks with the glass broken
and the sides crushed in.&rdquo; The old man held fast
to the girl, for she was perilously near the snow-hidden
edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;d better not try to go down to it,&rdquo;
he said, after a moment of silent observation.
&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; to hold on to till ye get to that ledge
an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s plain to see that the box isn&rsquo;t alongside o&rsquo;
the lamp. Howsome-ever, it bears out my notion
that things was hurled hither and yon when the
tower fell so thar&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; whar the little box
landed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>Then, drawing the girl back to a place of greater
safety, he continued, as he glanced at the sky: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
gettin&rsquo; toward midafternoon, colleen, an&rsquo; those blizzardy
lookin&rsquo; clouds over on the horizon ar&rsquo; spreadin&rsquo;
fast. I reckon as how we&rsquo;d better put off huntin&rsquo;
for the box till arter thar&rsquo;s been a thaw; then, likie&rsquo;s
not, we&rsquo;ll find it easy when the snow&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Uncle Barney,&rdquo; the girl replied. &ldquo;We
will do just as you think best, but how I do wish
that, just for a moment, I might visit my dear old
Treasure Cave. Don&rsquo;t you suppose that if we went
along the beach I might be able to climb up to it?
I&rsquo;ve been there many a time in winter and I know
just where my steps are even under the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes were so glowingly eager that the
old man could not refuse. &ldquo;Wall, wall, Rilly gal,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;d have time to poke around a
while longer if &rsquo;twould be pleasin&rsquo; to you. The
storm&rsquo;s likely to hold off till nigh dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Uncle Barney.&rdquo; Muriel
caught the old man&rsquo;s mittened hand and led him
along at a merry pace, breaking a path in the snow
just ahead of him. At last they reached the very
spot where many months before Muriel had stood
when she had beheld a city lad for the first time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye ever hear from Gene Beavers nowadays?&rdquo;
the captain asked when Rilla recalled to him the
incident of which she had been thinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, and, oh, Uncle Barney, such wonderful
times as Gene is having. He has a new
friend in England whom he calls Viscount of Wainwater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man gazed at his companion in uncomprehending
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Viscount of Wainwater is it? Rilly, can I
be hearin&rsquo; right? Why, gal, he&rsquo;s as big a man as
thar is in all England barrin&rsquo; the king himself. He&rsquo;s
what folks call a philanthropist, though thar&rsquo;s them
as calls him an Irish sympathizer; but &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t the
Irish only that he&rsquo;s benefactin&rsquo;, but all as are down-trodden.
Why, Rilly, he &rsquo;twas that bought a whole
township over in Connaught and tore down the mud
huts and had decent little cabins built for the old
folks to be livin&rsquo; in. Many&rsquo;s the time he&rsquo;s ridden
by on that han&rsquo;some brown horse of his an&rsquo; stopped
at me mither&rsquo;s door for a bit of refreshment an&rsquo; it
was me ol&rsquo; mither that couldn&rsquo;t talk of anything for
days but of how foine a gintleman was the Viscount
of Wainwater. It&rsquo;s curious now, ain&rsquo;t it, that Gene
Beavers is arter knowin&rsquo; him. It sartin is an honor
to be a friend of the viscount.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>As the captain talked, Muriel, surefooted on the
rocky paths that she had followed since childhood,
led him down to the beach, where the sand had been
swept clear of snow by the prevailing winds. They
walked around the island and stood just beneath
the cave to which Muriel had carried every little
treasure that had been given her by her few friends
or that had been tossed high on the beach by the sea.
The trail looked very steep and slippery to the old
man. &ldquo;Rilla gal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ll stay here
a bit and he waitin&rsquo; for ye while ye do yer explorin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl, her cheeks rosy, her eyes glowing,
laughed back at him over her shoulder, for she was
already half way up the trail.</p>
<p>When Muriel reached the shelving rock in front
of her cave she turned and waved to the old man,
who stood watching far below, then stooping, she
disappeared.</p>
<p>To her amazement, she found that the place was
flooded with light. The reason she quickly discerned.
Great rocks, hurled from the falling tower,
had crashed through the roof of the cave and were
piled high on its floor. Eagerly the girl began to
search among them for the box.</p>
<p>When fifteen minutes had passed and she did not
reappear, the old captain became anxious and
climbed to the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I&rsquo;ll be gigger-switched!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;if
here ain&rsquo;t the door to the closet whar the tools for
the big lamp was kept.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>Muriel, with a delighted cry, sprang toward him,
but stumbled over some small hard object which
had been almost imbedded in crumbled sandstone.</p>
<p>It was the long-sought little iron box, but it was
locked.</p>
<p>The old man was as excited as the girl. He took
the small box which Muriel lifted toward him and
examined it. &ldquo;The lock don&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s tools in the cabin that&rsquo;ll open it soon enough.
Come now, &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t do to be delayin&rsquo; any longer.
Can&rsquo;t ye hear the threatenin&rsquo; sound the wind is
makin&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s moanin&rsquo; into the cave here like a graveyard
full of ghosts let loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were again on the beach the girl saw
that the captain was indeed a weather prophet, for
the leaden-grey clouds were being hurled toward
them by a wind that was momentarily increasing in
velocity. Luckily it came from over the sea and
the water between the island and Tunkett would
still be sheltered.</p>
<p>They were soon in the dory scudding toward the
home port, but barely had they landed when the
snow began to fall so thick and fast that they could
scarcely see each other.</p>
<p>The wind from the sea fairly blew them up the
street toward the home of Doctor Winslow. For a
moment the old Irishman drew the girl under the
shelter of an evergreen tree while he said hurriedly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rilla gal, I reckon &rsquo;twould be best if I sent the
letter, bein&rsquo; as that was yer grand-dad&rsquo;s wish, an&rsquo;,
like&rsquo;s not, ye&rsquo;d better not be mentionin&rsquo; it to anyone
yet fer a spell, not knowin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The old man
paused. He did not want to hurt the girl&rsquo;s feelings
by saying that after all these years her own father
might not care to claim his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Uncle Barney,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not say a word, but, oh, how I do, do hope that
my own father will love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening the little iron box was opened, the
address found and Molly, who at one time had been
a school mistress in Connaught, penned the letter
that was sent speeding to its destination on the midnight
train.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<h2 id="c39"><br />CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br />A LETTER FROM GENE.</h2>
<p>When Muriel entered the house she found awaiting
her a letter from Gene, and strange indeed was
the postmark, for with his good friend, the Viscount
of Wainwater, the lad was traveling in foreign
lands.</p>
<p>There were several sheets of thin paper and these
were covered with such fine handwriting that it took
the girl much longer than usual to decipher them.</p>
<p>She retired to the doctor&rsquo;s den directly after the
evening meal, and having made a fire on the hearth,
she curled up in a big, comfortable chair near the
reading table, for she felt that she wanted to be
alone while she had this visit with the far-away lad
who called himself her brother-friend.</p>
<p>The first part of the epistle was devoted to descriptions
of their travels and adventures.</p>
<p>Then came some personal news items, the most
astonishing of these being that Monsieur Carnot
had received a cablegram informing him that Marianne
was leaving High Cliffs Seminary at once and
would return to France to complete her education.
Her reason for this unexpected action was not given.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>Another page was devoted to the viscount. &ldquo;Sister-friend,&rdquo;
Gene had written, &ldquo;how I do hope that
some day you may meet this wonderful man whose
conversation is to me more delightful than any book
I have ever read, whose considerate thoughtfulness
of all whom we meet, especially those who are poor
or in trouble, makes him more a nobleman than does
his title.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have saved until the close of this long, rambling
letter a bit of news that will rejoice your
heart, even as it did mine. You will recall that you
told me that I might show your poem, &lsquo;The Lonely
Pelican,&rsquo; to my poet-friend, Wayne, but that you
would rather that I did not tell him about yourself,
although why you made the request I am sure I cannot
guess. Muriel, I don&rsquo;t want you ever to be
ashamed of who you are, for though your parents
were simple fisherfolk, you are a princess among
girls. I am as proud to know you as I am to know
the Viscount of Wainwater. This was his comment
when he finished reading your little poem:
&lsquo;Gene, I would be glad had I written that. It is a
lovely thing.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel, some day may I tell him about you; how
your little girlhood was spent cradled out there on
Windy Island among the wild sea waves, companioned
by that splendid old man who was one of
nature&rsquo;s truest noblemen, and with only birds and
Shags for playmates? He will better understand
your poem. Address your next letter to Cairo, care
of the American Consul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time Muriel sat curled up in that deep
cushioned chair gazing into the fire and dreaming
dreams. How strange, how unreal, that she, the
daughter of a long line of seafaring people, should
be the friend of a lad who was the chosen comrade
of a viscount, and yet Gene had spoken truly, no man
could be more noble than her own grandfather.</p>
<p>Then came a tap on the closed door and the
pleasant voice of Miss Gordon: &ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock, dear.
You know our resolution&mdash;to retire at that hour.&rdquo;
Instantly Muriel was on her feet, rebuking herself
for having left Miss Gordon alone. Opening
the door, she said: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in? It won&rsquo;t
matter, will it, if we stay up a little later this evening?
I would like you to read this wonderful letter
from Gene Beavers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was that Miss Gordon was ensconced in
the big comfortable chair and with Muriel on a
stool at her feet, the older woman read the letter
aloud. &ldquo;What a privilege it is for your friend Gene
to have the companionship of that prince among
men. I have often greatly admired the verses of
Wayne Waters, and, dear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The older woman
paused and looked thoughtfully into the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>As she had hesitated, Muriel glanced up questioningly.
&ldquo;I had thought that I would not tell
you,&rdquo; Miss Gordon continued, &ldquo;but now I believe
that I will. Before we left High Cliffs, Miss Humphrey
found a poem in a new magazine, the title of
which was &lsquo;The Moor in Winter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Gordon, then you have found out
about Marianne and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew all the time, Muriel, and did not tell
me?&rdquo; The girl bowed her head. &ldquo;Yes. Gene had
written telling me about that poem.&rdquo; Suddenly looking
up, she inquired: &ldquo;Is that why Marianne is
leaving High Cliffs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Miss Humphrey is acting
principal during my absence and she has expelled
the young plagiarist.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<h2 id="c40"><br />CHAPTER XL.
<br />JOY AND FAITH VISIT TUNKETT.</h2>
<p>The blinding snowstorm which had started the
night before, as Muriel and Captain Barney had returned
from Windy Island, increased in fury during
the night and even Muriel did not care to battle
through the elements the next day to visit the cabins
on the dunes. She indeed was curious to see the
address to which the letter was to be sent and she
looked eagerly out at the storm, wondering how
long it would last.</p>
<p>Miss Gordon was so interested in her book that
she did not notice Muriel&rsquo;s suppressed excitement.
The girl could think of nothing but the letter and
its possible reception by the Mr. Storm, who, of
course, was her father.</p>
<p>What if this unknown father might prove to be
someone for whom she could not care? But she
put that thought away from her. Of course she
would dearly love the man whom her girl-mother
had loved and trusted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>Then she wondered how far the letter would have
to travel to reach him and how long a time would
elapse before she would have a reply. Would that
reply bid her go to another part of America to live?</p>
<p>It was midmorning when the girl&rsquo;s revery was interrupted
by the ringing of the telephone. Skipping
to the doctor&rsquo;s study, she lifted the receiver and
upon hearing the voice at the other end her face
brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Lem, I&rsquo;m so glad you were able to
get away. Yes, I&rsquo;ll send Jabez right down to the
station. You want Brazilla to make a double quantity
of clam chowder. Why, Uncle Lem, how hungry
you must be. All right, I&rsquo;ll tell her. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t that the jolliest!&rdquo; Muriel beamed at
Miss Gordon, whose book had been dropped to her
lap when she learned that Doctor Winslow was in
town. Into the kitchen the girl skipped when Jabez
had been notified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do to help?&rdquo; Rilla asked, and Brazilla
replied: &ldquo;Well, maybe you&rsquo;d better fetch out
the best cloth and set the table extra fine. I reckon
another log on the hearth would make the dinin&rsquo;-room
more cheerful like. Then thar&rsquo;s a geranium
on the south window sill that blossomed this morning.
You might put that in the middle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it in the middle of the fire?&rdquo; the girl asked
merrily. Then she whirled about and kissed the
astonished housekeeper on the forehead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Brazilla,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t mind
my nonsense. I&rsquo;m so excited about something that
I can&rsquo;t tell yet that I don&rsquo;t know what I am about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I should say, Rilly, that suthin&rsquo; onusual
must a-gone to yer head. You don&rsquo;t act at all natural,
an&rsquo; yer cheeks are so red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, anxiously, the good woman added: &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t feel feverish, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Brazilla. Honest Injun, I&rsquo;m all right. Now
I&rsquo;ll get busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The table was all set, and most attractive it looked
when the joyous ringing of sleighbells was heard in
the drive.</p>
<p>Muriel waited until she heard a stamping of feet
on the front porch, then she threw open the door
and uttered a cry of joy, for with the good doctor
were her two best friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Joy! Faith! What a wonderful surprise!&rdquo;
In spite of their snowy garments she hugged them
both, then whirling and shaking a finger at the
doctor, she accused: &ldquo;Now I know why you pretended
to be so ravenously hungry and ordered a
double portion of clam chowder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty!&rdquo; The doctor kissed his glowing-eyed
ward; then, leaving the girls with their hostess, he
went into the living-room in search of Miss Gordon.
He found her standing by the fireplace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; he said impulsively as he advanced toward
her, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t know what it means to me to
find you waiting to welcome me by my own hearth-side
which for so many years has been deserted and
lonely; so lonely, Helen, since mother left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just why there were tears in the sweet grey eyes
that were lifted to him Miss Gordon could not have
told, for the realization had come to them both that
this was truly a moment for rejoicing; but all that
the little woman said was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been lonely, too,
Lemuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that moment into the room danced Muriel,
leading the two laughing girls, whose heavy wraps
had been removed.</p>
<p>The older woman turned to greet them and the
physician went to his own room to prepare for his
evening meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this just like a party?&rdquo; Rilla exclaimed half
an hour later when they were seated about the long
table. &ldquo;Oh, girls, I had been hoping that you would
come for a week-end, as you had promised, but how
did you happen to be with Uncle Lem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We met Doctor Winslow in the station at New
York and when we told him that we were coming
to stay at the inn in Tunkett for a few days he declared
that we must be your guests in his home, and,
of course, we were only too glad to accept.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<p>Many times during the evening repast the physician&rsquo;s
eyes wandered to the face of his ward. Her
cheeks were glowing, almost feverishly, and the
light in her eyes was unnatural and her excited chatter,
he was sure, was not entirely because of the
unexpected arrival of her friends.</p>
<p>When they were leaving the table, he drew her
aside, saying, &ldquo;Muriel, I would like to see you in
my study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl excused herself and accompanied him.
As soon as the door was closed, the physician turned
and placed his cool hand on her cheeks and brow.
He said: &ldquo;Little girl, are you ill or has something
happened that is troubling you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To his great surprise Muriel threw her arms
about his neck and began to sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Uncle Lem, nothing troubles me; that is, it
doesn&rsquo;t yet. Uncle Barney has written a letter to
my own father to tell him about me, and, oh, Uncle
Lem, what if he should not care for me? Every
night since I was little I&rsquo;ve prayed for that dear
father who never came for me, and I&rsquo;ve prayed God
to send him to me some time because my girl-mother
so loved him; but now that at last he is to
know about me I am so afraid that he will not
want me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, then, had been the real cause of her feverish
excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>The physician drew Muriel down beside him upon
a couch and asked her to tell all that had happened.
He had never known about the address in the little
iron box, for although he had been a close friend
of Ezra Bassett&rsquo;s in their boyhood, the physician
had been away much of the time in later years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; he said comfortingly, &ldquo;do not be fearful.
The little that I have heard of your artist father
leads me to believe that, although evidently poor,
he was possessed of high ideals and was very talented.
I cannot believe that he has purposely neglected
you all of these years. Now dry your tears
and go back to your friends with a happy heart and
be sure that the tender love you have given your
father is now to be returned to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the girl had left him, the physician bent
his head on his hands. And so he was to lose Muriel.
One by one those who were dear to him had
left him and in his old age he was to be alone, for it
would be presumptuous on his part to ask so lovely
a woman as Miss Gordon to share the little he had
to offer. But at that moment he recalled the tears
in the grey eyes and the break in the voice that had
said, &ldquo;I, too, have been lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, he thought, &ldquo;I will go to Helen and ask
her if she cares to share my home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<h2 id="c41"><br />CHAPTER XLI.
<br />MURIEL HEARS FROM HER FATHER.</h2>
<p>Once again it was spring. The trees about High
Cliffs Seminary were pale green and pink with unfolding
fresh young leaves and in the orchard back
of the school the cherry, peach and apple trees were
huge bouquets of fragrant bloom, spreading a feast
for the bees that hummed cheerily among the flowers.
Now and then a meadow lark sent its shaft of
song rejoicing through the sunlit morning from
somewhere beyond the tennis courts where three
girls were playing, with but little animation, however,
as the first real spring weather was too warm
to be invigorating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we knew what has happened to sadden
our Rilla,&rdquo; Catherine Lambert said when, the set
having been finished, the girls sat on a bench to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came back to school after the Christmas
holidays so joyous that I thought some wonderful
thing had happened like a romance or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A romance and Muriel not yet eighteen years of
age!&rdquo; This protestingly from Faith. But Catherine,
heeding not the interruption, continued: &ldquo;But
that could not have been it, for now she seems very
sad. I should think that you two girls who are so
intimate with her might ask what has happened.
Surely she is troubled about something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could <i>truly</i> say that I have noticed no
change in Muriel,&rdquo; Joy remarked, as she looked
meditatively toward the orchard; &ldquo;but I cannot, for
she is changed. She studies harder than ever before,
if that can possibly be. Miss Gordon told me
that she had never known a pupil at High Cliffs to
make such progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Miss Gordon knows what is troubling
Muriel? I am sure that she would, if anyone
did,&rdquo; Faith said, but Joy shook her head. &ldquo;No,
Miss Gordon does not know, for last week she asked
me to come to her apartment at an hour when
Muriel was occupied in the music room and she
asked me if I had noticed a change in Rilla, and if
so, had I any idea what had occasioned it. I said
that we all realized that Muriel seemed sad, but
that we did not know the reason. Then Miss Gordon
declared that she would write Doctor Winslow,
who has been in the South for a month with a patient,
and ask him what he thought might be troubling
his ward. If this source of possible information
fails, Miss Gordon will ask Rilla herself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>While these three friends were discussing Muriel
as they sat out by the tennis court, that maiden was
seated alone beneath the little pine tree that had
been her comforter in those first lonely days before
she had become acquainted at High Cliffs. In her
hand she held a letter and there were unshed tears
in her eyes. Although her Uncle Barney&rsquo;s name
was signed at the close of the missive, Muriel knew
that Molly had penned it for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearie,&rdquo; the girl read, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no news yet,
though it does seem like there ought to be. Here
&rsquo;tis May and the letter we wrote was sent last December.
Folks do say, &lsquo;no news is good news,&rsquo; but
I reckon this time, colleen, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t so. If your father
was living he&rsquo;d have sent some sort of an answer.
It would be going against nature not to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he hadn&rsquo;t lost the letter with the address on it,
or if we could remember it, we&rsquo;d write again. &rsquo;Twas
a name I&rsquo;d never heard before, nor had Molly. I
reckon that old letter got into the stove, somehow,
and so there&rsquo;s no way to write again. Seems like I
can never forgive myself if the fault is mine. Your
loving Uncle Barney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, after all, the dream ended. Muriel was never
to know the father she had loved so long. With a
sigh that was half a sob, she arose and walked slowly
back toward the school, when she saw one of the
younger pupils racing toward her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Muriel Storm, you&rsquo;re wanted in the parlor.
There&rsquo;s someone to see you. It&rsquo;s a man and he&rsquo;s
elegant looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel&rsquo;s heart leaped. Could it be that her father
had come, after all?</p>
<p>When Muriel appeared in the doorway of the reception
room, Miss Gordon rose, as did the man who
was at her side.</p>
<p>Advancing with outstretched hands, the principal
said: &ldquo;Dear girl, why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about it?
I wasn&rsquo;t at all prepared for the message that this
gentleman has brought to us.&rdquo; Then turning to the
man, who was gazing with unconcealed interest at
the tall, beautiful girl, Miss Gordon added: &ldquo;Muriel,
this is Mr. Templeton of London. He has come
at the request of your father, who is not strong
enough just now to make the voyage, and, if you
desire, you are to return with Mr. Templeton at
once. Your passage has been engaged on a steamship
leaving Hoboken tomorrow at daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl gazed from one to the other as though
scarcely able to comprehend. Then, slowly, a light
dawned in her clear hazel eyes and she said: &ldquo;My
father, my own father, he wants me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Templeton was deeply moved and stepping
forward he took both hands of the girl as he said
sincerely:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Miss Muriel, he does want you. I never
saw a man more affected than he was when he
learned that he had a daughter living. He wanted
to come to you at once, but he has been ill and his
physician advised against the voyage as the sea is
none too quiet in the spring. And so I have been
sent to accompany you to your father if you will
trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s questioning gaze turned toward Miss
Gordon, who smilingly nodded. &ldquo;It is right, dear,
that you should go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have telephoned
to Dr. Winslow and he will be here this afternoon.
Now you had better go to your room. I will send
a maid to help you pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon leaving the reception room Muriel had gone
at once in search of her best friends and had found
them all in Joy&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been hunting for you everywhere,&rdquo; Faith
said. &ldquo;We wanted you to make a fourth on the
courts, but you were nowhere about, so we had to
play alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the speaker paused and gazed intently at the
morning glow in the face of her friend. &ldquo;Why,
Muriel,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;of late you have seemed
troubled, but now you are radiant. Tell us what has
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although every moment was needed for preparing
for departure, Muriel paused long enough to tell
these, her dearest friends, that at last her own father
had been found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rilla, it&rsquo;s like a chapter in a story-book, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Joy exclaimed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel strange and unreal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Muriel laughed. &ldquo;I suppose that I do, but girls,
I haven&rsquo;t time now to feel anything, for I must pack
and be ready to leave for New York on the evening
boat. Uncle Lem is going to keep me at the hospital
tonight, and I am to meet my escort at Hoboken
tomorrow morning before daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been a whirl of a day and when at last
came the hour for parting with Miss Gordon and
the girls who had been such loyal friends, Muriel
suddenly realized that, though she was to gain much,
she also was losing much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anything in the world could take
me from you all but just my father,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prophesy that you&rsquo;ll see us soon,&rdquo; Miss Gordon
said briskly, for she knew the tears were near.
Luckily the whistle of the boat at that moment
warned the friends that they must go ashore, but
they stood on the dock and waved until the small
craft was out of sight.</p>
<p>Then it was that Muriel recalled a letter that Miss
Widdemere had given her at the last moment.
Taking it from her coat pocket, she saw that it
was from Gene, who was again in London.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">[304]</div>
<h2 id="c42"><br />CHAPTER XLII.
<br />MURIEL MEETS HER FATHER.</h2>
<p>To the surprised delight of Muriel, both Uncle
Barney and little Zoeth were at the boat to bid her
goodbye. Doctor Winslow had at once wired the
good news to the old man who had been instrumental
in finding the girl&rsquo;s long-lost father and his
deeply furrowed, weather-beaten face shone with
joy as he held out his arms to Rilla, heeding not at
all the jostling throng of voyagers who were eager
to board the greater steamer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your pa, Rilly gal? What&rsquo;d the lawyer
chap tell yo&rsquo; about him?&rdquo; Muriel shook her head.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a bit more about it than you do,
Uncle Barney,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;My father wished
me to form my own opinion when I met him, and
so he asked Mr. Templeton to make no attempt to
describe him to me. I&rsquo;m glad really. One never
can picture people as they truly are. All that matters
to me is that he is my father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">[305]</div>
<p>Then Doctor Lem returned, having attended to
the baggage, and they all accompanied Rilla to her
stateroom. &ldquo;Take good care of Shags for me,&rdquo;
were her last words to Zoeth, &ldquo;and tell him I&rsquo;ll come
back after him as soon as ever I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Muriel leaned over the rail and waved to
her loved ones on the crowded wharf until the huge
steamer had swung out into the channel.</p>
<p>The voyage, although of great interest to the girl,
who so loved the sea, was uneventful, and in due
time England was reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so this is London,&rdquo; Muriel said one foggy
morning as she glanced out of the window of the
conveyance which Mr. Templeton had engaged to
take them to their destination. &ldquo;I am so glad that
my father does not live in the city.&rdquo; Then she inquired:
&ldquo;Is he a farmer, Mr. Templeton?&rdquo; Rilla
recalled that when in Tunkett the young man had
seemed to be very poor, but he might have sold
paintings enough since then to have bought a farm.</p>
<p>Mr. Templeton&rsquo;s expression was inscrutable.
&ldquo;Why, yes, Miss Muriel; in a way your father might
be called a farmer. All kinds of vegetables and stock
are raised on his place. But&mdash;er&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t wield
the pitchfork himself these days. He is rather too
prosperous for that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">[306]</div>
<p>How glad the girl was when they were out on the
open road. The hawthorn hedges were white with
bloom and so high that in many places they could
not see over them into the parklike grounds they
were passing.</p>
<p>Suddenly Muriel touched Mr. Templeton&rsquo;s arm
and lifted a glowing face. &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Did you hear it? Over there in the hedgerow.
There it is again. Oh, I know him! Miss Gordon
has often read the poem.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the wise thrush. He sings each song twice over</p>
<p class="t0">Lest you think he could never recapture</p>
<p class="t0">That first fine, careless rapture.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like Browning&rsquo;s poetry, Mr. Templeton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, really, Miss Muriel, I&rsquo;ve never had much
time to read verse; been too busy studying law. But
your farmer-father sets quite a store by the poets,
he tells me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; was the radiant reply. Then the
girl fell to musing. How she hoped that her dear
mother knew that at last she was going to the poor
artist whom she had so loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it be before we reach the farming
district, Mr. Templeton?&rdquo; The girl was again gazing
out of the window at her side. &ldquo;These homes
that we are passing are like the great old castles I
have read about in Scott&rsquo;s books and Thackeray&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">[307]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will soon reach our destination,&rdquo; was the
non-committal reply of her companion. Then, leaning
forward, he spoke a few words to the man at
the wheel.</p>
<p>They turned down a side road that narrowed to
a winding lane. There the conveyance stopped and
Mr. Templeton directed Muriel to a picturesque
cabin half hidden among trees, in front of which
ran a shallow babbling stream. &ldquo;Your father awaits
you in there,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>As one in a dream Muriel crossed the rustic
bridge and approached the cabin. It was just the
sort of a home that an artist would build, she
thought.</p>
<p>Timidly she knocked on the closed door. It was
flung open by a man nearing middle age, perhaps,
but whose youthful face was radiant with a great
joy. Taking both her hands, he gazed at her devouringly.
Then, drawing her to him, he crushed
her in his arms as he said, his voice tense with emotion:
&ldquo;My Rilla&rsquo;s own little girl, and my girl, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">[308]</div>
<h2 id="c43"><br />CHAPTER XLIII.
<br />RILLA OF THE LIGHTHOUSE.</h2>
<p>It was June, one year since Muriel Storm had
arrived in England, and again she was returning
to the home of her ancestors, after a long trip to
Switzerland, where Gene had visited her and her
father. During this year, Muriel had acquired from
her father an ease of manner which well fitted her
for the position she was to fill.</p>
<p>Invitations to the debut of Lady Muriel were
crossing the Atlantic. They were addressed to the
four girls at High Cliffs who had befriended her
when she was supposed to be only the grand-daughter
of a lighthouse-keeper. Others bearing the Wainwater
crest were addressed to dwellers in Tunkett&mdash;to
Doctor Winslow and his lovely wife; to Brazilla
Mullet and her brother, Jabez Mullet; to Uncle
Barney and his Molly.</p>
<p>In London Mrs. Beavers and Helen received
their invitation. There was a flush of pleasure on
the elder lady&rsquo;s face as she read the message on the
crested card. &ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will wonders
never cease? The Viscount of Wainwater has a
daughter. Probably she has been away at school
all these years and that is why we have not heard
of her.&rdquo; Then, as her gaze wandered to a handsome
pictured face on a table near, she added: &ldquo;I
am glad now that Gene did not care for Marianne
Carnot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">[309]</div>
<p>Helen laughed. &ldquo;Mother, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what
a matchmaker you are! It is unfortunate that
brother seems to care for Muriel Storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Beavers haughtily, &ldquo;I
wish you never again to mention the name of that
seafaring girl in my presence. I am so glad that
your brother will be home from college in time to
attend the debut.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The day of the great event had arrived. Helen
and her mother were dressed and waiting for the
carriage to convey them to Wainwater Castle. But
the elder woman was troubled, for though the boat
from America had docked and the train from Liverpool
had arrived two hours before, yet Gene had
not come. Then she heard his voice in the lower
hall, asking, &ldquo;Where is my mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catching her outstretched hands, he exclaimed
admiringly: &ldquo;Did ever a chap have so beautiful a
mother?&rdquo; Not waiting for a reply, he added wheedlingly,
&ldquo;Mother, darling, are you as hard-hearted
as ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am never hard-hearted, son, where you are
concerned. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">[310]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mother mine, I have come to ask your permission
to marry the most wonderful girl in this
world, whose name is Muriel Storm. Am I right in
believing that you really care for my happiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my son, I care for nothing else; it will
be a great disappointment to me to have you marry
the daughter of a lighthouse-keeper, but if you are
convinced she is the girl you love, I will welcome
her for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, mother,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you will never regret
those words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after the last guest had arrived at the
castle, the orchestra was stilled, and the viscount
spoke. &ldquo;Friends and neighbors, I have invited you
here tonight to rejoice with us. I wish to announce
the engagement of my daughter to one of the finest
lads I have ever known, Gene Beavers. And now
it gives me great pleasure to present to you my
daughter, the Lady Muriel of Wainwater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Beavers was scarcely able to believe what
she had heard and seen. As one in a trance, she
advanced, and Gene leaped to meet her and placed
Muriel&rsquo;s hand in that of his mother. &ldquo;My boy&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;I thought&mdash;is this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsively the girl held out her other hand as
she said in her most winning way: &ldquo;I want you to
love me. I am Rilla of the Lighthouse.&rdquo;</p>
